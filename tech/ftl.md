🚀 Propulsion & FTL Systems – The Last Centurion and Fleetcraft
⚙️ Sublight Propulsion — “GravArc Ion Arrays”
Used By: The Last Centurion, shuttles, fighters
Role: Standard system-to-system travel, orbital maneuvering, evasive thrust

Based on artificial mass-displacement compression, these ion arrays generate gravitic thrust envelopes without traditional fuel.

Power-dense, maneuverable for a capital ship, but not atmospheric unless supported by VTOL boosters.

Limited to fractional light speed (0.1c max burst) for sustained interplanetary travel.

Supported by inertial compensation rings, so the crew doesn’t turn into soup at high-G burns.

“Smooth as a whisper. Loud as a scream.” — Dash on the sublight system's vibe

🛸 Shuttle-Class FTL – “Lattice Drive” Systems
Vessels: The Whisper & The Arclight
Drive Type: Hybridized Hyperspace-Warp Shunt Array
Range: Mid-tier. Ideal for multi-planet or regional system travel. Not full galactic jumps.

Mechanics:
The drive forms a synthetic corridor through semi-stable dimensional latticework, not true hyperspace nor classic warp.

Each jump takes hours or days depending on distance and corridor alignment.

Navigation requires precision—especially in Veil-rich zones, where distortion fields can lead to bleed-over anomalies.

Risks & Limits:
Gravity wells slow or scatter the lattice stability—can’t jump from inside a planet’s orbit.

Cooldown time: 4 to 10 hours between jumps depending on duration and energy burn.

🌀 Capital-Class FTL — The Last Centurion’s “Rift Spine” Jump Drive
Drive Type: Quantum-Pulse Rift Engine
Range: System-to-system jumps; must chain jumps to cross longer distances
Jump Duration: Instantaneous
Cooldown Time: 6 to 18 hours depending on jump size, distortion level, and reactor load
Spinal Drive Length: Extends the entire dorsal vertebrae of the Centurion, powered by a fusion-Veil hybrid reactor core

🧠 How It Works:
The Rift Spine bends local space not by traveling through it, but by briefly collapsing the ship’s spatial signature, reprinting it into a stabilized echo in another location via a quantum-anchored field coil array. This mimics a “snap teleport” through the fabric of space.

“It doesn’t fly. It doesn’t push. It doesn’t tunnel.
It leaves a ghost… and follows it.”
— Sierra, on Rift theory

Limitations & Narrative Hooks:
Cannot jump too far at once. The longer the range, the more anchor nodes and calibration time required.

Navigational errors can cause phasing issues—passengers report headaches, déjà vu, or shadow hallucinations after high-stress jumps.

Cooldown limits emergency follow-up. Once the jump is done, you’re committed to that system for hours, maybe days.

Eve regulates the jump cycles and safeguards against burnout—but Caylee once overclocked it to cut cooldowns in half… and nearly ripped the medbay into 6 dimensions.

🛑 Fighter-Class Propulsion
Fighters do not possess FTL drives.

Fighters must be deployed in-system only—launched after The Last Centurion arrives via jump, or carried aboard shuttles for field deployment.

This makes recovery and timing critical—if the Centurion jumps mid-engagement, fighters are stranded until retrieval.

Navigation Systems
Eve oversees all course plotting—her AI matrix runs quantum probability mapping against known rift anomalies.

Sierra handles Veil-sensitive alignments—occasionally needed to stabilize or "read" anomalies affecting jump logic.

Dash hates jump space and throws up in her helmet at least once per arc.
