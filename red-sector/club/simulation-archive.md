# 🧠 Club Centurion — Erotic Simulation Archive

> “Desire isn’t programmed. It’s rendered.”

Housed in a secure Red Sector subdeck and supervised by Eve, the Erotic Simulation Archive provides fully immersive sensual scenarios tailored to crew preference, performance, and privacy protocols.

All simulations are opt-in and logged only by biometric key. These files represent some of the most frequently accessed, whispered-about, or intentionally corrupted sim cycles aboard the Last Centurion.

## 🔒 Featured Simulations

| Title | Participants | Description |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Scenario 7A: The Shadow Duel** | Kayla / Seraphim | Combat tension becomes something far less restrained in the middle of a power cut. |
| **Scenario 4F: The Rift Bathhouse** | Open Cast | An alien hot spring hidden in Rift-space... steamy, surreal, and euphoric. |
| **Scenario 13C: The Captain’s Quarters (Unlocked)** | Kaiden / User | Private command fantasy. Respect, discipline... then heat. |
| **Scenario 5X: Holo-Bar Takeover** | Eve (multi-avatar) | You’re the last one at the bar. The bartender has thoughts. Many bodies. |
| **Scenario 21R: Shuttle Drift** | Dash / Caylee | A floating transport. No one’s watching. Zero-g doesn’t stop friction. |
