## 🍹 Signature Cocktails

| Drink | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Voidfire Kiss** | A swirling mix of hellroot whiskey and Riftfruit extract. Glows faintly. Spicy, smoky, and dangerously addictive. |
| **Nebula Bloom** | Lavender gin, elderflower foam, a touch of starlit ice. Floral, sweet, and deceptively strong. |
| **Starfall Slammer** | Three shots, layered and ignited. Best consumed mid-dance, barefoot. |
| **Caylee’s Trouble Tonic** | No one knows what’s in it. Caylee won’t say. Changes color based on your mood. |
| **Red Sector Rush** | A layered aphrodisiac — heat-spice rim, chilled velvet liqueur, and a stimburst finish. Must be consumed under supervision. |

## 🥂 Non-Alcoholic Elixirs

| Drink | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Cryo Cider** | Chilled apple-cranberry blend with flash-frozen spice pearls |
| **Pulseberry Fizz** | Tart and electric. Tingles on the tongue. Favorite among junior officers. |
