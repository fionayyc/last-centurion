The bridge is dark. Not dead—never dead—but quiet. That warm hum of systems idling, engines whispering in sublight drift. The overheads are dimmed to deep violet. Stars pour through the forward viewport like soft, liquid glass. No alarms. No chatter. No duty.

Just me.

I’ve got my jacket half-zipped, clinging to my shoulders like a lover's hands. My sports top’s damp from drills earlier. Haven’t changed. Didn’t feel like it. Didn’t even bother with pants—just a pair of sky-blue bikini bottoms, high-cut and thin enough to feel the leather of the command chair as I shift.

I’ve flown us through hell and came out with burn marks shaped like wings.

But right now?

I need something I can’t pilot through.

I lean back in the captain’s seat—mine for the night. Feet kicked up on the console, one toe tracing the navigation throttle idly. I let my hand drift over my stomach, nails dragging down the line of my abs, just light enough to tease. My pulse ticks against my ribs.

"Computer. Lock bridge. No interruptions."  

**[Confirmed. Lock engaged.]**

I bite my lower lip as I slide my fingers under the band of my panties. The cotton's already damp. Not from thinking about combat. Not from Seraphim’s wink earlier. But from the thought of her watching. Of being seen. Of being known.

I circle my clit, slow, deliberate. The nerves there light up like a fresh kill on radar.

God, I’m soaked.

I let out a shaky breath. Eyes half-lidded. My hips roll against my palm, heel pushing into the chair, back arching just a little. The viewport flickers with stars like they're dancing for me. Or maybe I'm dancing for them.

The sound of my breathing fills the space. The slick, sinful sound of fingers on flesh. I spread my legs wider. Fuck.

Then I hear it.

A hiss. Soft. Like a hatch.

I freeze.

Not scared. Just... caught.

I open one eye.

Seraphim?

No. Not her.

Caylee.

She’s standing just inside the dark. Barefoot. Eyes wide and gleaming like molten gold. Her fur is bristled. She wasn’t expecting this. But she’s not running.

She licks her lower lip.

"Didn't mean to interrupt," she says, voice husky. She’s in a tank top and cargo shorts, one hip cocked, a toolbelt slung lazy over her ass. "But... I couldn’t sleep. Eve told me someone was on the bridge. Thought it was a glitch. Guess not."

I grin. I don’t stop touching myself. “You watching, sparks?”

She nods.

"Come closer."

She does.

By the time Caylee’s standing between my spread thighs, my hand’s soaked. I hook a finger into the waistband of my panties and pull them aside, baring everything.

“You want a taste?” I ask, voice low.

Caylee drops to her knees like a girl with faith. Eyes locked on mine the whole time.

Her tongue is rough, hungry, eager like she’s been dreaming about this since the first time I smacked her on the ass in Engineering. She laps at me slowly, reverently at first—then deeper. More insistent. She’s growling softly, and I swear I see stars explode behind my eyes.

I bury my hands in her short, messy hair, grinding into her mouth. "Fuck, Caylee... just like that."

I let go. For real. Moaning into the silence, the clean sterile air filled with the heat of her tongue and the slap of wet skin and breath and need.

And then—

I see her.

Seraphim.  

Leaning in the shadows. Watching. Smiling.

But that’s another log.

This one’s Caylee’s.

And tonight?

She gets to burn with me.
