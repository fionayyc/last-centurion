The water was hot, pounding off silver tiles and onto slick bodies. Steam curled through the locker room, hazing the mirror walls and catching the low hum of overhead lights. Caylee stood naked beneath the downpour, head tilted back, fingers buried in her fur, scrubbing stubborn streaks of something from the backs of her thighs.

“Fucking pollen-lube,” she muttered. “This shit’s still leaking.”

From a few lockers down, Dash snorted, towel slung over one shoulder, tits out, fur streaked with green stains that glowed faintly in the steam.

“You said you wanted to see the ‘exotic local flora,’ remember?” she grinned, stepping into the adjacent stall, water soaking her rainbow-dyed tail. “That thing really made you one with nature.”

Caylee groaned, then laughed. “I didn’t ask to be a fucktoy for an interdimensional root-rapist, Dash.”

“Could’ve fooled me,” Dash said, lathering up her chest. “You were moaning louder than the wildlife.”

Flashback: Three Hours Earlier – Planet Xylaris III
Lush. Overgrown. Wet.

Bioluminescent leaves pulsed around them in the jungle heat, the air thick with spores and aphrodisiac mist. Caylee had wandered off—again—chasing a strange heat signature while Dash guarded the dropship perimeter.

Caylee’s voice had crackled over comms.

> “Uhhh… Dash? There’s some weird-looking vines back here. Moving on their own.”



She didn’t answer again for ten minutes.

When Dash found her, she was suspended—naked, clothes shredded and hanging in tatters from flowering branches. Her legs were spread by thick, muscular vines, her arms pinned overhead. And from her dripping, moaning mouth down to her stretched ass, Caylee was being used.

Three tentacles worked her over—one plunging deep into her soaked cunt, another pumping slow, goo-slick thrusts into her ass, the third wrapped around her throat and tongue-fucking her mouth until her eyes rolled.

Her belly bulged slightly with the rhythm.

She choked around it, drooling nectar, eyes glazed.

> “Dash—hah—don’t shoot it—f-fuck it’s good—!”



Dash hadn’t moved for a full ten seconds.

Then she’d just leaned against a tree and said, “Well. This is going in the log.”

The monster seemed to take her encouragement. It doubled its rhythm—fucking Caylee like she was bred for it. Her entire body rocked in its grip, tits bouncing, stomach clenching with every orgasm that splashed out of her and soaked the grass below.

Dash didn’t interrupt. Not even when the vines spread her ass wider and started pumping thick, glowing spores into her womb. Caylee came again—loud, messy, uncontrollably—as her belly swelled with hot, writhing sap.

> “I’m full—ohfuckI’m—gonna pop—!”



It took ten minutes and half a magazine of pulse rounds to get the thing to release her.

Now – Showers
Dash grinned as Caylee bent over under the water, one hand digging between her legs, the other tugging her tail aside.

“You still leaking?” she teased.

Caylee huffed. “I swear it laid something. I can feel them shifting when I cough.”

“Let me check.” Dash stepped closer, letting her claws part Caylee’s slick folds. A slow whistle followed.

“Damn, still stretched wide. He wrecked your holes, babe.”

Caylee looked over her shoulder, winking. “Kinda hope he left a number.”

Dash slapped her ass—wet, loud, perfect.

“Turn around,” she said, voice lower, heated. “I’ll help you rinse the rest out… but I’m not using just water.”

Caylee grinned, licking her lips. “You using tongue, flygirl?”

“Oh, I’m gonna fuckin’ mop the floor with it.”
