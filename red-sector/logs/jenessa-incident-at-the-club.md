# Stardate 7724.15 — Incident in the Club

## Narrative Report

The club thrummed like a living thing — bass punching through the floor, strobe lights cutting the haze into shards of pink and silver, the air thick with heat, liquor, and sweat. Behind the bar, **Jenessa Nicole** owned every inch of the space.

She was a blur of spotted gold and black, the glint of her **amber eyes** catching the light as she worked. Bottles spun in her hands, shakers rattled with precision, drinks slid down the polished counter without spilling a drop. She chatted with regulars, teased new faces, and always, always knew exactly where every credit chit landed. Her tail swayed behind her in lazy counterpoint to the music, but her ears never stopped moving — catching conversations, footsteps, and the faintest changes in the room’s pulse.

That’s why she heard the drone before anyone saw it.

The low hum of anti-gravs cut under the music, wrong enough to make one ear twitch. She didn’t stop pouring a multi-layered shot, didn’t even glance up until the crowd began to part. The drone was sleek, hostile, eyes glowing like embers, its weapon ports cycling.

Jenessa’s smile was small and sharp.

The targeting laser found her chest. Her left hand set the completed shot on the bar for a confused patron. Her right dipped under the counter, fingers curling around the vibro-knife hidden there.

One flick of her wrist — a flash of steel and vibrating hum — and the blade sang through the air. It struck dead-center in the drone’s optic, shattering the lens with a wet pop. Coolant and sparks sprayed in a violent arc as the machine seized, dropped, and smashed through a table in a mess of splintered glass and metal.

The cheer from the crowd was almost instant. Someone whistled. Jenessa wiped the blade clean on a bar towel, slid it home, and reached for the next bottle. “Order up,” she said, as if nothing had happened.

But across the room, **Kayla Jade** hadn’t taken her eyes off her.

The hellhound tactical officer leaned against a support pillar, arms folded, gaze hot enough to burn through the crowd between them. That faint curl to her lips was part approval, part hunger.

Jenessa caught it, held it, and let her own smirk answer. Then she stepped out from behind the bar, brushing past Caylee — who was frozen mid-pour, staring — and closed the distance to Kayla.

“You liked that,” Jenessa said, low enough for only her to hear.

Kayla’s eyes dipped briefly to the curve of Jenessa’s mouth before rising again. “You make killing look… obscene.”

Jenessa’s claws trailed down the inside of Kayla’s forearm before closing around her wrist. “Then you’re going to love what comes next.”

She pulled her toward the side door without a backward glance. Behind them, Caylee’s half-shouted, “Wait—seriously?!” was cut off by the door closing.

The VIP lounge was shadowed and lush — velvet drapes, low couches, the faint scent of expensive liquor and something sweeter underneath. Jenessa pressed Kayla back against the wall, sliding one knee between hers.

“You’ve been staring all night,” she murmured, amber eyes catching the low light. “Now I’m going to see what you taste like when you can’t think straight.”

Kayla’s answering growl was cut short by Jenessa’s mouth crashing into hers, heat and teeth and tongue tangled.

Jenessa’s claws curled just enough to bite into the hellhound’s hips, pulling her forward against the press of Jenessa’s thigh. Kayla’s hands roamed instantly, sliding up the cheetah’s back, tracing the lines of muscle beneath her fitted dress.

Without warning, Jenessa spun Kayla toward the nearest low couch, pushing her down onto the cushions. Her hands made quick work of the jacket — already half-off — then hooked into the waistband of the hellhound’s shorts, dragging them down to mid-thigh. The scent of heat and want hit her instantly, sharp and intoxicating.

Jenessa dropped to her knees, parting Kayla’s legs without asking. She leaned in, the rasp of her tongue dragging slowly up the inside of one thigh, close enough for Kayla to shiver, but just shy of touching where she wanted.

Kayla’s growl was low, impatient. “Don’t tease me.”

Jenessa’s teeth grazed sensitive skin before she finally closed her mouth over her, tongue working in deep, slow strokes that had the hellhound’s head tipping back against the couch. Every movement was deliberate — precise circles, sudden flicks, pausing to suck until Kayla’s hips jerked against her face.

The cheetah’s claws dug into her partner’s thighs, holding her exactly where she wanted her. Every time Kayla tried to grind harder, Jenessa pulled back, forcing her to ride the edge until her breath came in desperate gasps.

“Fuck—Jenessa…” Kayla’s voice was breaking now, the growl dissolving into raw sound.

Jenessa’s grin was wicked against her, and she doubled her pace — fast enough now to make Kayla’s entire body tense, tail curling hard. The first climax hit sharp, Kayla’s claws digging into the couch, thighs clamping around Jenessa’s head. She didn’t stop.

Amber eyes locked on Kayla’s flushed face, Jenessa kept working her, the rhythm relentless. Another shudder, another cry — Kayla’s second release was messier, louder, the air thick with scent and sweat.

Only then did Jenessa ease back, licking her lips, the faintest trace of Kayla still glistening there. She leaned forward, bracing over the hellhound, and kissed her deep, letting her taste herself.

Kayla laughed between panting breaths. “You’re dangerous.”

Jenessa’s smirk was pure satisfaction. “And you’re late getting back to work.”

From outside, muffled through the door, Caylee’s voice cut in faintly: “If you two are *done*, I’m drowning out here!”

Jenessa’s tail flicked lazily as she stood, straightened her dress, and tossed Kayla’s shorts back to her. “She’ll live.”
