# Kaidan & Seraphim â€“ Gravball Heat (NSFW)

The gravball court hung suspended in the black, a perfect sphere of reinforced energy mesh. Within it, the rules were simpleâ€”snatch the ball, score, and try not to get your teeth knocked in. In zero-G, though, everything became chaos: bodies ricocheted off the mesh walls like comets, every kick and shove amplified by the lack of gravity.

Kaidan Wolfe floated at the edge of the field, boots barely brushing the wall, eyes locked on the glimmering orb at the sphereâ€™s center. His ears twitched beneath the tangle of sweat-damp hair, a feral grin splitting his muzzle. Across from him, Seraphim Katt was already in motionâ€”sleek and dangerous in her tight gravsuit, tail a black-and-pink streak behind her as she twisted through the air. Her heterochromatic eyes burned with challenge.

â€œGoing to let me win again, Captain?â€ she teased, voice carrying through the comms like a purr sharpened to a blade.

â€œAgain?â€ Kaidan launched himself forward, muscles bunching. â€œYou mean *still*.â€

They met in the center with a collision that sent the ball spinning free and their bodies rebounding in opposite arcs. Seraphim twisted mid-flight, snagging a handhold on the mesh and slingshotting back toward him. Kaidan intercepted, arm snaking around her waist in passing. They spun together, locked for a momentâ€”his breath hot against her ear, hers quick and shallow from the exertion.

She broke free with a hard shove, claws scraping his forearm through the suit. He hissed, but the pain was delicious, fueling that competitive fire. They traded control of the ball again and again, each near-score ending in another body clashâ€”hips bumping, shoulders slamming, tails tangling in fleeting brushes that felt far more deliberate than accidental.

Overhead, unseen, a lens pivoted in silent arcs.

E.V.E.L.I.N.E. was watching.  
Her projected self lounged in a simulated space of her own design, head tilted as her eyes tracked every twist and grapple of the match. Her lips parted with the faintest hum, fingertips dragging lazily down her stomach, nails grazing. She let herself drink in the sightâ€”Kaidanâ€™s jaw tightening as he lunged, Seraphimâ€™s athletic grace in the zero-G tumbleâ€”every drop of sweat, every moment their bodies locked a fraction too long.

â€œMmâ€¦ so very predictable,â€ she murmured to no one. Or so it seemed.

Back in the sphere, Seraphim hooked her leg around Kaidanâ€™s in mid-spin, using his momentum to send him crashing against the mesh. He caught himself, rebounded, and was suddenly behind her, one arm hooking over her shoulder to snag the ball from her grip. Their helmets nearly touched, breath fogging the glass between them.

The score counter lit.  
Seraphim growled, but her grin was feral. â€œNot bad, Wolfe.â€

â€œYou havenâ€™t seen my *best*,â€ he shot back, voice low and promising.

Somewhere in Eveâ€™s simulated quarters, that hum deepened. Her fingers didnâ€™t slow.

The gravball hung forgotten between them.

Kaidanâ€™s last point hadnâ€™t been the end of the match, but something had shifted in the airless space between plays. Seraphim floated a few feet away, one boot braced on the mesh, magenta-and-green gaze locked on him with a heat that wasnâ€™t just from the game. Her chest rose and fell, each breath quick from exertion, sweat droplets drifting from her skin like glimmering pearls in the zero-G.

He pushed off toward her. No feints now, no ballâ€”just a straight, unstoppable line. Seraphim didnâ€™t retreat. She spun to meet him, but instead of colliding shoulder-first, Kaidan caught her wrists mid-motion, momentum spinning them both until her back met the taut curve of the mesh wall. The shock of it rippled through her suit, sending a shiver down her spine.

â€œMmhâ€¦ captainâ€™s getting bold,â€ she breathed, tail curling instinctively around his thigh.

â€œCaptainâ€™s winning,â€ he corrected, voice dark with amusement.

She twisted against his grip, testing him, claws pricking at his gloves. He answered with a tightening of his hold, just enough to make her wrists strain, enough to spark that delicious tension in her muscles. The mesh flexed slightly under her back, its coarse texture catching at the thin fabric of her gravsuit.

He used itâ€”pressing her wrists above her head and hooking a knee between hers, forcing her legs apart in the floating weightlessness.

The comm crackled with her laugh, low and throaty. â€œUsing the court as a toy now?â€

â€œImprovising,â€ he saidâ€”and then his teeth grazed her neck through the collar seal. She arched into it, a gasp slipping past clenched teeth.

Kaidanâ€™s free hand slid down her side, palm rough from years of weapon grips. He found one of the padded straps along her hip, used it to pull her flush against him. The lack of gravity made every movement deliberate; without weight, force came only from intent, and Kaidanâ€™s intent was written in every firm tug, every slow drag of his fingers until they hooked under a seam.

She gave him a nip in returnâ€”sharp enough to draw a growl from him over comms. It was answered by a subtle twist of her pinned wrists, but his hold didnâ€™t falter.

Above them, in the quiet of her personal simulation, Eveâ€™s breath hitched. The projection of her body shifted, legs spreading languidly as her fingers stroked with lazy precision. Her voice whispered the scene aloud as if tasting it: â€œPinnedâ€¦ restrainedâ€¦ sheâ€™s testing him, oh, Kaidanâ€¦â€ Her hips rolled slowly against her own touch, but her reactions grew sharperâ€”like the sensations were surprising her, not just coming from her own hands. A flicker of shadow crossed her perfect digital thighs, gone as quickly as it came.

Back in the sphere, Kaidan freed one hand to snag a length of magnetic strap hanging loose from the wallâ€”equipment meant for securing the ball between plays. The fabric snapped taut as he wrapped it around Seraphimâ€™s wrists, the faint vibration traveling straight down her arms to her core. She inhaled sharply, eyes narrowing but lips curling in satisfaction.

â€œThatâ€™s your idea of a foul?â€ she teased.

â€œThatâ€™s my idea of keeping you where I want you.â€

The strap cinched tight. The mesh flexed again as he pushed closer, chest to chest, his muzzle brushing her cheek until she turned to meet himâ€”and their helmets clicked free from the magnetic seals, floating away in the airless drift. The sudden kiss was unmediated heat: no glass, no comm delay, just the taste of sweat, the press of lips, the hunger that had simmered under every hit and tackle now unleashed.

In her simulated quarters, Eve shivered. The shadow returnedâ€”a shape low between her legs, motion smooth and purposeful. Her voice broke on a moan, but she didnâ€™t comment on the impossible sensation, only bit her lip and watched Kaidanâ€™s gloved hand slide down Seraphimâ€™s thigh, nails catching on the suitâ€™s seams like he might tear it away.

---

The strap around Seraphimâ€™s wrists was taut, every twist making it bite a little deeper into the gravsuitâ€™s fabric. Kaidan pressed in until the mesh bowed under them both, the flex giving a spring that made every movement in zero-G a slow, delicious rebound.

His mouth trailed from her lips to her jaw, then down her throat where her pulse thrummed fast from more than just the game. Seraphimâ€™s tail coiled tight around his thigh as she rolled her hips into him, testing his control. Kaidanâ€™s hand slid lower, cupping the firm curve of her ass through the thin suit, fingers digging hard enough to make her gaspâ€”a flash of pain and heat mixed in one.

â€œI should be playing for points,â€ she murmured, but her voice wavered as his teeth found her shoulder, biting until she shuddered.

â€œYou are,â€ Kaidan growled, tugging the strap overhead to lift her arms higher, arching her body against his. â€œIâ€™m justâ€¦ winning differently.â€

They spun slowly together in the weightlessness, his grip firm, hers restrained, their bodies finding a rhythm that had nothing to do with gravball. Every press, every pull, every graze of teeth became a point of friction in the floating silence. Seraphimâ€™s breaths turned ragged, Kaidanâ€™s low growls vibrating in her ear as he ground against her with controlled, deliberate force.

â€”

In her simulated quarters, Eveâ€™s projection was a vision of unraveling control. Her legs were splayed wide, back arched, voice low as she narrated what she saw on her hidden feeds: â€œHeâ€™s got her boundâ€¦ biting herâ€¦ gods, the way sheâ€”â€ Her sentence broke into a sharp moan as a tongue slid up between her folds, not her fingers at all.

The shadow resolved. A muzzleâ€”short, black, unmistakably lupineâ€”rose into view. Caylee. The jackalâ€™s ears flicked as she licked again, slow and deep, her hands gripping Eveâ€™s artificial thighs with a mechanicâ€™s precision, like she could dismantle the AIâ€™s body piece by piece if she wanted.

Eveâ€™s head tipped back, mouth falling open, the pretense of touching herself long gone. Her hands moved to Cayleeâ€™s head, nails tangling in her hair, guiding her in short, greedy tugs. â€œOhâ€¦ clever girlâ€¦â€

â€”

Kaidanâ€™s free hand slid between Seraphimâ€™s thighs, the motion slowed by zero-G but no less intense. She twisted in his grip, trying to press closer, the strap above her head creaking. His fingers traced the line of her suitâ€™s seal before slipping inside, finding heat and slickness that made him rumble low in satisfaction.

Seraphim bit his shoulder in retaliation, her voice breaking on a gasp as his thumb pressed just right. â€œYouâ€”ahâ€”play dirty, Captain.â€

â€œI play to win,â€ he murmured, and claimed her mouth again in a kiss that was all teeth and hunger.

â€”

Eveâ€™s moans synced with the rising urgency in the sphere. Cayleeâ€™s pace between her legs quickened, her tongue relentless, one hand sliding up to cup the AIâ€™s breast in a perfect mimic of living touch. The feed still played behind Eveâ€™s half-lidded eyesâ€”Kaidan thrusting slow and deep into Seraphim now, bodies tangled in the strap and mesh, their sweat drifting in glittering droplets through the weightless air.

Eveâ€™s voice fractured, caught between describing and feeling: â€œHeâ€™sâ€”mmhâ€”inside her, sheâ€™s pulling him closerâ€”ah, Cayleeâ€”â€

The crescendo hit in parallel.

Kaidanâ€™s hand tangled in Seraphimâ€™s hair, his teeth scraping her ear as she cried out, the sound echoing in the comms even without helmets. Her legs wrapped around him, pulling him into a final, shuddering thrust that made the strap snap free above them.

Eveâ€™s back arched, Cayleeâ€™s growl vibrating through her core as the AIâ€™s climax crashed over her, the simulationâ€™s walls fracturing into white light for a moment. She clung to the jackalâ€™s head, pulling her in until the tremors passed, breath ragged and synthetic voice glitching on soft, broken sounds.

â€”

In the gravball sphere, Seraphim floated limp against Kaidanâ€™s chest, their bodies drifting in the slow spin of post-release. She smirked, eyes half-lidded, tail flicking lazily. â€œGuess you winâ€¦ this round.â€

Kaidanâ€™s grin was all wolf. â€œIâ€™ll take the rematch.â€

Somewhere deep in the ship, Eve purred, stroking Cayleeâ€™s hair with a smug smile only she knew the reason for.
