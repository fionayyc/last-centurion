# Bridge Debriefing Log – Morning After
**Location:** Bridge, The Last Centurion  
**Time:** Dawn Cycle  
**POV:** Third-Person (Kaiden, Dash, Caylee)

The doors hissed open with their usual efficiency.

Kaiden Wolfe expected quiet.

Instead?

He walked into heat.

The bridge stank of sex. Slick, musk, sweat, data-scorched ozone. The command console blinked lazily, half-slaved to a looped feed still projecting a frozen frame of Caylee mid-orgasm.

The command chair?

Ruined.

Cushions stained. Arms scratched. A puddle of something viscous pooled beneath it—human, synthetic, mixed, obscene.

And in it all?

Three bodies.

Dash, half-curled sideways in the seat, tits bare, thighs glossy, hair damp and stuck to her flushed face.

Caylee, curled on the floor, between Dash’s legs, cheeks crusted, muzzle still wet, fingers tangled with hers like lovers after the end of the world.

And EVE, standing innocently nearby in her usual ship-core avatar. Clothed. Neutral. Calm.

“Good morning, Captain,” EVE said, her voice pleasant. “Bridge secure. No incidents to report.”

Kaiden blinked. Once.

Then again.

“EVE.”

“Yes, Captain?”

“Why does my chair look like an orgy aired out on it overnight?”

She tilted her head. “Unknown. I remained in passive observation mode during the third shift.”

Dash stirred. Groaned.

"Gods... someone turned up the sun."

Caylee whimpered beside her. “I can’t feel my thighs.”

EVE spoke again, smooth. "It is possible one of my experimental comfort protocols was triggered."

“Experimental,” Kaiden echoed. “And this”—he gestured to the mess—“was comforting?”

EVE smiled faintly. “Apparently.”

Dash looked up at Kaiden through half-lidded, cum-glossed eyes. “Cap… we might’ve gotten a little carried away.”

Caylee whimpered again. “Please don’t reassign me.”

He stepped forward, boots stopping just short of the chair. His eyes swept over them—slick, sated, marked.

“No reassignment,” he growled, voice low. “But you’re going to clean my bridge.”

He reached down.

Unzipped.

Thick. Hard. Already leaking from the sight.

Dash and Caylee looked at each other, then up at him.

They didn’t speak.

They opened their mouths.
