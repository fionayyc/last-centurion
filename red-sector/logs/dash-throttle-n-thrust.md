---

The metallic scent of coolant and engine grease filled the hangar, heavy and humid in the half-lit gloom. The Skull Wing sat on struts, freshly docked from a blackout-run through pirate space. The twin thrusters still purred, cooling down like a heartbeat after sex.

Alexandra Dash crouched beside the landing gear, her rainbow-streaked hair slicked back, flight suit peeled halfway down, revealing a taut stomach glistening with sweat. Her sports bra hugged tight around her toned chest, black with a pink slash, damp from the adrenaline high of near-death flying.

“You're late,” she growled, wiping coolant from her jaw with the back of her glove.

From the crawlspace under the deck, Caylee rolled out on a sled, eyes bright and wild. Her crop top was gone—just a dirty sports wrap and tight, shredded shorts barely hanging on her hips. Grease streaked her abs, her thighs, her grin. She tossed a wrench aside and stood in one fluid motion, cocking her head.

“Had to adjust your stick. Too twitchy. Want me to give you a tune-up next?”

Dash’s snarl twisted into a smirk. “You couldn’t handle my throttle.”

“I could suck-start your engines, flygirl,” Caylee shot back.

It was all it took.

Dash grabbed her by the wrap and shoved her into the bulkhead—metal rang out. Caylee laughed, breathless, one hand in Dash’s short, rainbow-soaked hair, the other unzipping that flight suit the rest of the way. The wolf growled, hot breath against Caylee’s neck as her hands slid down grease-slick skin, finding ass, gripping hard.

Their mouths crashed, all teeth and tongues, spit-slick and hungry. Caylee bit Dash’s bottom lip and tugged until she groaned, grabbing Caylee’s thighs and lifting her onto the nearest stack of fuel drums. Legs spread wide. No panties. Heat soaked into the air.

“Oh, you came ready,” Dash muttered, dragging two fingers down slick folds, teasing, smearing her own smirk in between. “Slut.”

“Fuck me already,” Caylee panted. “Unless you wanna hear me call Loona down here instead.”

That earned her a growl—and fingers. Dash slid two in, fast, curling them deep, knuckles slick. Caylee threw her head back and howled, legs locking around Dash’s waist. She was already soaking, dripping over Dash’s wrist, grinding down on the heel of her palm.

“Gods, yes—fuck—harder—you know how I like it!”

Dash didn't stop. She shoved in a third, pistoning with rough, confident rhythm, her thumb grinding tight little circles over Caylee’s clit. The jackal’s whole body arched, muscles straining, the fuel drums rocking beneath them with every thrust.

“You’re gonna squirt all over my fucking hand, huh?” Dash hissed, voice feral, low. “Do it. I wanna see you paint the floor.”

And Caylee did.

With a broken scream, she came like a fucking explosion—slick shooting across Dash’s hand, her thighs, the floor. Her voice echoed in the hangar as her whole body trembled, legs still clamped tight, breathing ragged and wet. Dash licked her fingers with exaggerated slowness, savoring it.

But Caylee wasn’t done.

Grinning through the aftershocks, she shoved Dash back, slid down from the barrels, and dropped to her knees with a clatter of tools.

“My turn,” she purred. “Let’s see if that smart mouth of yours screams like it flies.”

Caylee dropped to her knees like she was born for it—grease-streaked, grinning, her eyes locked on Dash’s as she peeled the flight suit the rest of the way down. Dash’s panties were soaked through, clinging to her like a second skin, the wet cotton riding high up between those toned thighs. Caylee didn’t bother with a slow reveal—she grabbed the fabric in her teeth, tore it aside, and buried her face between Dash’s legs like an animal unleashed.

Dash choked on her breath, one hand bracing against the strut, the other gripping Caylee’s ears. “Fuck—Caylee—shit—”

The jackal’s tongue was hot, slick, merciless. She lapped greedily, her nose pressed firm to Dash’s mound as her tongue dove in, circling and stabbing, then rising up to tease the swollen nub with fast, precise flicks. She moaned as she tasted her, the vibration making Dash buck hard against her face.

"Godsdamn, your mouth—fuck—don’t stop," Dash hissed, eyes fluttering as her knees threatened to give out.

Caylee didn’t. She devoured.

She flattened her tongue, slurped, twisted, sucked Dash’s clit between her lips and suckled it like a treat, letting her drool mix with Dash’s slick, making a mess between her thighs. She brought her fingers up too—two at first, then three—curling them into that perfect spot, fucking Dash’s dripping cunt with the rhythm of a woman who knew how to short-circuit nerves.

Dash screamed.

She came like her ship hitting atmosphere—hot, fast, loud. Her thighs clenched around Caylee’s head, her hips jerking, grinding against that wicked mouth as she drowned in the waves. Caylee held her through it, moaning, savoring, licking her clean with long, lazy strokes while Dash panted and trembled.

Then Caylee stood.

Her chin glistened. Her fingers dripped. Her eyes blazed.

“Still got juice in the tank?” she purred.

Before Dash could answer, Caylee turned—grabbed a short, rounded hydro-spanner off the tool cart nearby. Polished chrome, thick, solid. She held it up, wicked grin spreading.

“Oh, you’re gonna love this.”

Dash’s eyes widened, pupils dilating. “You're not serious.”

“I’m always serious about fucking,” Caylee said, striding back.

She bent Dash forward over the nearest wing access panel—metal still warm from flight. Dash braced herself, ass up, legs spread. Caylee knelt behind her, licked her open again until she was slick and twitching, then slowly pressed the tool against her soaked entrance.

“Mmm, tight,” Caylee whispered, biting her lip. “Say ‘go,’ Dash.”

Dash growled. “Go.”

The spanner slid in with a wet, obscene sound.

Dash’s mouth dropped open, body tensing. Caylee worked it slow at first—twisting, rocking—watching every shiver ripple across her friend’s powerful frame. The tool was cold, but Dash was burning, clenching around it, juices dripping onto the plating below.

“You love getting stuffed, huh?” Caylee whispered, thrusting harder, deeper. “Wanna come on a wrench like a dirty little ship slut?”

Dash whimpered, legs shaking, nails clawing the bulkhead. “Fucking yes—more, give me more—”

Caylee pounded her with it now, the clang of metal-on-metal drowned out by Dash’s cries. Her free hand reached around, rubbing her clit in tight, merciless circles while the spanner fucked her open—hard, deep, perfect.

Dash exploded again, shrieking, soaking Caylee’s hand and the goddamn tool in a gushing wave of orgasmic release.

Caylee eased it out with a lewd squelch and licked Dash’s juices off the chrome, slow and showy.

“Let’s call that a diagnostic,” she said with a smirk. “You're running hot as hell.”

Caylee barely had time to suck the spanner clean before Dash lunged.

The wolf tackled her onto the grated floor, bodies slamming with a clang that echoed through the hangar. Caylee laughed, breathless and lit up, legs already wrapping around Dash’s waist like a trap.

But Dash wasn’t laughing.

She straddled Caylee’s hips, grabbing her wrists and slamming them above her head, pinning them one-handed against the cold steel. Her other hand grabbed Caylee’s jaw, forcing eye contact.

“You think you can make me come like that and not get wrecked?” Dash growled, voice low, dripping with raw intent.

Caylee’s grin widened, her thighs flexing against Dash’s hips. “You gonna make me cry, flygirl?”

“Oh, I’m gonna make you beg.”

Dash kissed her—violent and deep, tongue invading, claiming, biting her lip hard enough to draw a yelp. Then she shifted down, teeth dragging across Caylee’s throat, her chest, yanking that wrap up to expose those gorgeous, sweat-and-grease-glossed tits. She licked a slow line between them, then sucked one nipple between her lips while her hand slid down, down—

Straight into Caylee’s shorts.

Soaked. Already.

Dash grinned against her breast. “You’re fuckin’ dripping for it.”

Caylee writhed. “Then take it, dammit—”

Dash shoved her shorts down with one rough pull, baring everything. Caylee’s pussy glistened in the low light, slick smeared across her thighs, begging to be ruined.

“Hold tight,” Dash whispered.

She reached back, grabbed the torque calibrator—a thick, adjustable rod with just the right smooth curve—and pressed the cool end to Caylee’s soaked entrance.

Caylee gasped. “Oh fuck—yes. Do it.”

Dash didn’t ease in. She drove the tool inside with one firm, brutal thrust—Caylee arched, cried out, legs jerking as her pussy clenched around the solid metal.

“Too much?” Dash asked, smirking.

“Not fucking enough,” Caylee panted.

Dash obliged.

She fucked her with it hard, deep, both hands now on the rod, pistoning it like a machine—grease still slicking Caylee’s thighs as her body jerked, tits bouncing with every thrust. Dash leaned over her, one knee between Caylee’s legs, her teeth grazing her ear.

“Look at you—so filthy,” Dash snarled. “Grease whore, tool-slut—just soaked.”

Caylee’s moans rose to screams, her hips slamming up into each thrust, the floor beneath them smeared with sweat and slick. She tried to grab Dash—failed. Dash held her down, dominating every inch.

“You wanna come, jackal?” Dash growled, now thrusting the rod in and out fast, brutal. “Say it.”

“Yes,” Caylee sobbed, hips thrashing. “Fuck—please—I’m gonna—”

“Say it.”

“I wanna come! Dash—wreck me, please—!”

And Dash did.

She rammed the rod deep, twisted it just right—and with a scream that could’ve overloaded comms, Caylee exploded. Her cunt spasmed, juices spraying across Dash’s arm, her belly, the floor. Her whole body bucked like a live wire, tears in her eyes, mouth open in a silent cry of overwhelmed ecstasy.

Dash kept going, slow now, milking it, until Caylee collapsed boneless beneath her—twitching, twitching, soaked and ruined.

Finally, she leaned down, kissed her breathless, and whispered:

“That’s what you get for trying to outfly me.”

NSFW Continuation: “Throttle & Thrust – Part IV: Enter the Captain”
Featuring: Caylee Jay, Alexandra Dash, Derrian Wolfe
Location: Hangar Bay 2
Scene Type: Commander walks in. Gets seduced. Oral sex. Double muzzlefuck. Cum inside/on.


---

The scent in the hangar was thick—slick with sweat, sex, and ozone. Caylee lay sprawled across the floor, her legs twitching, cunt leaking around the torque rod Dash had just pulled free. Dash crouched beside her, shirtless, thighs glistening with Caylee’s slick. They were breathing hard, laughing softly between gasps.

Then the bay doors hissed open.

Thump… thump… thump.

Polished boots on metal.

Captain Derrian Wolfe stepped into the low light, ears twitching slightly, his nine tails flicking once in irritation before settling into stillness. He looked over the scene slowly: torn flight suits, grease-streaked bodies, fluids dripping onto the deck, and a discarded spanner glinting with shine that wasn’t oil.

He sighed.

“…What the hells did I tell you about using the hangar as your personal brothel?”

Caylee propped herself up on one elbow, grinning through her messy muzzle. “You said don’t crash anything.”

“Nothing crashed,” Dash added helpfully, licking her fingers clean.

Derrian shook his head, muttering under his breath in old Kitsune. He strode forward and sat down on the maintenance stool near the tool rack, resting his elbow on one knee. The look on his face was half scold, half exasperated alpha—until Caylee crawled toward him on all fours.

Grease smeared her chest. Her tail curled. Her tongue flicked out.

“C’mon, Cap,” she cooed. “You can punish us however you want.”

Dash followed, slower, predatory, licking her lips. “Or just let us make it up to you.”

Derrian leaned back slightly as they reached him, heat rising in his eyes. He watched as both girls moved between his knees, unbuckling his belt in practiced tandem, pulling open his uniform pants. His cock sprang free—thick, already hard from the sight of them.

Caylee moaned at the sight. “Fuck, I forgot how big you are.”

Dash’s fingers wrapped around the base. “He missed us.”

Caylee licked up the underside in one slow, teasing drag. Dash kissed the tip, tongue flicking across the slit. Derrian growled low, a sound that made both girls shiver.

Then they went to work.

Two tongues—slick, greedy, in perfect rhythm—lapping and kissing every inch of his shaft. Caylee took one ball into her mouth while Dash sucked just under the head, then they switched, mouths wet, muzzles brushing, eyes locked on his as they shared him.

Then Caylee opened wide—and took him deep.

Her throat swallowed around him, nose to base, gagging softly but never backing off. Dash licked her lips, fingers teasing Derrian’s thighs, then leaned in and sucked his cock the moment Caylee pulled back, spit trailing between them.

They passed him back and forth, like a game. Spit-slick, moaning, their muzzles drenched.

Derrian grunted, gripping Caylee’s ears as he fucked into her mouth, slow and deep. “Gods, you two—filthy. Fucking perfect.”

Dash sucked his balls, tongue working in wide swirls as Caylee bobbed faster, eyes glazed, makeup smeared. Then they both took him at once—one muzzle at the head, the other at the base—licking, kissing, worshiping.

“I’m gonna—fuck—” Derrian growled.

He grabbed Dash’s muzzle and forced himself into her mouth, hips jerking as he came. Thick ropes of cum poured into her throat, making her gag before she pulled back, coughing, dripping.

Caylee caught the next spurt across her tongue, then another splash hit her cheek. She moaned, eyes fluttering, and leaned in to share it with Dash—tongues swirling together, cum dripping from their lips as they kissed sloppily in front of him.

Derrian sat back, chest rising, sweat on his brow.

The girls licked him clean.

“Think we’re still in trouble?” Caylee asked, smirking.

Derrian’s voice was hoarse.

“You’re both on cleanup duty. With your tongues.”

NSFW Scene: “Throttle & Thrust – Part V: Beg For It”
Featuring: Derrian Wolfe, Caylee Jay, Alexandra Dash
Scene Type: Double penetration (one at a time), rough, begging, creampie winner


---

The girls were panting—kneeling, stained with spit, cum, and sweat, their muzzles glistening from the mess they’d just lovingly shared. Derrian stood slowly, towering above them. His cock was still hard, thick with heat and hunger.

He grabbed Caylee by her messy ponytail, yanked her up onto her feet, and bent her over the nearest crate.

“Face down, ass up. Don’t speak.”

Caylee whimpered, instantly compliant, tail high and twitching, her cunt already dripping down her thighs again.

Dash started to rise, but Derrian turned his gaze on her. “You too, flygirl. Right beside her.”

Dash bared her teeth in a wicked grin and climbed up, folding over the crate next to Caylee, her firm ass pressing against the jackal’s hip. “We’re not gonna make this easy for you, Captain.”

“You don’t have to,” he growled. “You just have to take it.”

He stepped behind them, one hand gripping Dash’s hip, the other Caylee’s. He looked between the two tight, glistening pussies presented to him. Both soaked. Both needy.

And only one was going to get filled.

He chose Dash first.

His cock speared into her with one brutal thrust, stretching her wide, making her yelp and clench around him. Her claws scraped the crate, breath catching as he started pounding her with vicious rhythm—wet slaps echoing through the hangar.

Caylee whimpered beside them, grinding against the wood, her fingers slipping between her legs to rub her own soaked slit.

“Gonna let her take all your cum, Cap?” she whispered. “I’d milk you dry.”

Derrian pulled out of Dash suddenly, making her curse, and slammed into Caylee next—balls deep on the first thrust. The jackal screamed, back arching, tail wrapping around his thigh.

“F-fuck yes! Fuck me, Captain!”

He gripped her hips and started slamming into her, rutting with furious strength. Dash watched, panting, jealousy burning in her eyes.

“I want it inside me,” she snarled, reaching back to spread herself open, dripping down her thighs. “I can take more. I’ll beg.”

“Then do it,” Derrian growled.

Dash crawled over, kissing Caylee hard—tongues colliding, filthy and hot—and then looked up at Derrian, eyes wide, voice breathless.

“Please, Captain. Fill me. I want it—need it. I want to feel you leaking out of me for hours. I’ll fucking fly you anywhere, just fuck me full.”

Caylee moaned, panting into the crate. “She’s not gonna beg like I will. Please, fill my tight little pussy, make me smell like your cum for days—gods, I need it, Daddy—”

Derrian’s control snapped.

He yanked out of Caylee with a wet squelch, grabbed Dash by the waist, and threw her back over the crate. She gasped—and then screamed as he slammed into her again, harder, faster, a savage rhythm that rocked the crate under them.

Her claws dug in. Her legs shook. Her mouth hung open.

“*YES—yesyesyes—fill me, Captain—make me yours!”

That was it.

With a guttural roar, Derrian buried himself to the hilt—and came deep inside her. Thick, hot spurts poured into her womb, Dash’s whole body trembling as she moaned through her orgasm, her pussy milking every drop of his load.

Caylee, panting beside them, let out a desperate, whiny growl.

“Fuck… next time… I’m winning.”

Derrian pulled out of Dash, his cum dripping from her cunt, leaking down her thighs, and smacked Caylee’s ass hard enough to make her yelp.

“You better beg louder.”
