It was supposed to be a quiet repair shift.

One of the dorsal stabilizers on the shuttlepod had been acting twitchy—nothing major, just something Caylee didn’t trust Eve to auto-correct. So there she was: stripped to her bikini top and cut-off shorts, covered in grease, sweat soaking into her fur, legs spread beneath the hull with a torch in one hand and a hydro-wrench between her teeth.

The heat from the arc welder matched the throb between her thighs. It had been weeks since she got off properly—too many missions, too many near-deaths, not enough time to fuck or get fucked.

And that’s when she heard them.

Heavy boots. Stumbling. A low laugh. The distinct hiss of a half-sealed hangar door behind her.

Caylee flicked off the torch, went still.

Two figures entered from the shadows—lithe and cocky, stumbling against each other, half-drunk and already pulling at clothing. Caylee squinted through the ambient glow of the overhead lights.

Dash.
Captain Wolfe.
Fuck.

She ducked beneath the pod, heart racing, the sharp tang of flux still on her tongue.

They were already at it.

Wolfe shoved Dash hard against the crate stacks near the rear bulkhead. She gasped, laughing, her flight suit halfway unzipped. He didn't say a word—he just grabbed the zipper, yanked it down to her navel, and tore the rest with his claws.

"You're a fucking menace," Dash growled, already panting.

"And you're wet enough to soak through your flight logs," Wolfe snarled.

Then he spun her around and bent her over the cargo crate.

Caylee froze, peeking from the shadows under the shuttlepod, wide-eyed, breath caught. Her hand slowly crept down between her thighs.

Wolfe didn't bother with finesse. He ripped Dash’s panties aside, exposing her slick, toned ass and glistening cunt, already dripping. His cock was thick—long, heavy, already hard—and he rammed it in without warning.

Dash screamed.

"FUCK—yes—Captain—fuck me like that!"

He did.

He fucked her like an animal. Feral, rough, claiming her with every thrust, claws digging into her hips, tails twitching behind him like a beast in rut. The slap of skin echoed through the bay, Dash’s moans climbing louder and louder.

Caylee was soaked. Her fingers slid beneath the hem of her shorts, rubbing her clit with tiny, desperate circles, breath catching on every thrust Wolfe gave Dash.

“Look at you,” he growled, slamming in deeper. “Always so smug in that cockpit—just a bitch in heat under it all.”

Dash moaned like it was praise, slamming her hips back onto him.

“Fill me—come on—inside me, I want it—fuck, I want it—!”

Wolfe snarled, leaning over her back, fangs at her neck.

Caylee couldn’t take it. She rocked forward slightly, thighs clenching—and her elbow knocked over the hydro-wrench with a metallic clatter that echoed across the bay like a shot.

Shit.

Everything stopped.

Wolfe’s head turned—eyes glowing. Dash looked over her shoulder, flushed, tits bouncing from residual motion.

“…Caylee?” Dash panted. “You perv.”

Caylee scrambled to sit up, but it was too late. Wolfe pulled out of Dash, cock slick and pulsing, and walked straight toward her—bare chest rising, abs clenched, expression unreadable.

“You like to watch, grease rat?” he asked, voice a growl.

Caylee’s mouth opened. Closed.

Then Dash stepped beside him, still bent slightly, thighs soaked, a finger dragging through her own cum-slick folds.

“She was touching herself,” Dash whispered, biting her lip. “Just watching us like a little heat-drunk voyeur.”

Caylee swallowed hard. Her hand was still in her shorts.

Wolfe crouched in front of her, massive cock hovering near her lips, pre-cum glistening.

“Then let’s see how much of a mess she can handle.”

Caylee's breath hitched as Wolfe’s massive cock hovered just inches from her lips—thick, veined, still wet from Dash’s cunt. She could smell both of them on it. The raw sex. The heat. It made her thighs tremble.

“Open your mouth,” Wolfe ordered, low and firm.

She obeyed.

He slid into her muzzle slowly—making her feel the weight of it—his free hand tangling in her hair as he groaned at the heat of her tongue. “Fuck… good girl.”

Behind her, Dash knelt down, still flushed and high on adrenaline, eyes gleaming.

“Oh, we’re gonna wreck you, gear slut,” she whispered, peeling down Caylee’s tiny shorts. “Let’s see how tight that slick little pussy is after spying on us.”

She didn't wait for permission.

Dash gripped Caylee's hips, spat once—wet, messy—right onto her folds, then shoved her fingers inside. Two, then three. Caylee gasped around Wolfe’s cock, gag reflex twitching as her eyes rolled. She was dripping, already twitching from the intrusion.

“Mmmph!”

“She’s soaked,” Dash laughed. “The little bitch loved watching us.”

Wolfe gave a short, low growl and began thrusting shallowly into her mouth—holding her still by the hair as her throat welcomed him inch by inch. Drool spilled down her chin, mixing with grease. Her eyes watered as he hit the back, paused… then pushed deeper.

Gag. Choke. Moan.

Behind her, Dash lined herself up—strapping on a hard, synthetic cock from the belt clipped to the crate. Black. Ribbed. Thick. Caylee felt the blunt head press against her pussy and moaned around Wolfe’s cock.

“You ready, baby?” Dash purred. “You wanted this, yeah?”

Caylee tried to nod. She couldn’t. Wolfe was in deep now, using her throat like it belonged to him.

So Dash fucked her.

The fake cock slammed inside, spreading her open, burying deep into her soaked pussy. Caylee screamed around Wolfe’s length, body jolting forward. Dash grabbed her hips and pounded her without mercy—her toned body slapping against Caylee’s ass in rhythmic, brutal motion.

Every thrust from Dash pushed Caylee forward—deeper onto Wolfe’s cock.

It became a rhythm.

Wolfe groaned, fucking her face with calm, dominating thrusts. “She’s a perfect fucktoy like this.”

Dash laughed, smacking Caylee’s ass. “Look at her—eyes rolling, drool everywhere. I think she came already.”

She had—Caylee’s thighs were shaking, her cunt pulsing around the synthetic shaft, dripping down her legs, making a mess on the hangar floor.

Wolfe’s thrusts became rougher. His fingers clenched tighter in her hair. “I’m gonna cum. You want it, slut? All over that messy tongue?”

Caylee whimpered. Begged with her eyes.

Dash slammed in one last time and reached under to rub Caylee’s clit furiously. “Do it, Captain. Fill her fucking mouth—”

With a savage growl, Wolfe came—thick, hot jets of cum coating Caylee’s tongue, throat, spilling from her lips as he held her down, cock twitching.

Caylee gagged once, then moaned—swallowing around him, body twitching violently as she came again, pussy clenching tight around Dash’s cock.

Dash leaned over her, breathing hard, her hips still rolling slowly.

“She’s gonna taste that for days,” she smirked.

Wolfe pulled out slowly—his cock slick and shining, Caylee’s lips red and raw.

He leaned down, grabbed her muzzle, and whispered:

“Next time… you ask before you watch.”
