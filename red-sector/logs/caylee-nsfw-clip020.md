> *â€œItâ€™s not leaking, itâ€™s venting. Totally different problem,â€* Caylee muttered, bent over the main coolant line with a hydro-spanner wedged between her teeth and sweat slicking the back of her crop top. She wore her usual: bikini top, shorts unbuttoned, and the persistent hum of music playing from a stray speaker bot in the corner.

The cameraâ€™s angle caught her from behindâ€”just as she wriggled underneath the control panel. Her tail flicked once in mild irritation, knocking over a diagnostics tablet.

A hiss of pressure filled the room as the panel seal cracked open. A puff of coolant vapor spilled out, misting her abs and chest with condensation. Caylee licked it off her lips without pausing her work.

> *â€œThere. Bleed lineâ€™s open. System just needed a release.â€*

As if summoned by the phrase, the doors slid open with a dry hiss.

> *â€œWhat exactly am I looking at?â€*

Loonaâ€™s voice was a growlâ€”bemused, not angry. She leaned in the doorway, arms crossed, wearing a tank and combat sweats. The low light flickered against her piercing red eyes.

Caylee rolled onto her back and grinned upside down at her.

> *â€œRedline test. Hands-on troubleshooting. Wanna supervise?â€*

There was a pause. Loona entered the room without a word, the doors closing behind her.

The log becomes partially corrupted here. Audio remains:

---

> *â€œYou call this â€˜routine maintenanceâ€™?â€*  
> *â€œI call it relieving pressure where it builds up. You look tense, by the way.â€*  
> *[unintelligible - fabric shifting, low growl, laughter]*  
> *â€œSay when.â€*  
> *â€œNow. Right fuckingâ€”â€*  
> *[moan, metal clatter, thud]*

**System Note:** Engineering sensors reported an unexplained 0.05% rise in internal temp across Deck 2. Hydro-conduits required recalibration the following morning.
