Caylee Jay straddled the console, socket wrench in one hand, a spark wand in the other, wearing nothing but a grease-smeared crop top and low-slung utility belt. The glow from the engine core pulsed like a living heart behind her, throwing pale blue firelight over her toned jackal form, sweat-slicked and flushed. Her ears twitched, sensors flickering with rogue mana waves. Even her tools were tingling—literal arcane feedback pulsing through the ship’s wiring like a lover’s whisper.

Something was wrong with the inertial dampeners—or so she'd claimed. Truth was, the ship had slipped into one of those chaotic magic pockets in the Rift again, where reality bent to desire and the ship responded to touch like a living thing. Caylee knew it. Loved it.

She moaned softly, hips grinding against the warm alloy of the console, the nanosteel humming beneath her in sympathetic resonance. “Mmmph… Eve, reroute auxiliary through port 7 and—hah—don’t watch this time.”

> E.V.E.L.I.N.E. (dryly): “I’m not watching. I’m recording. For diagnostics. Obviously.”



“Pervert,” Caylee smirked, sliding her fingers under the waistband of her shorts. They barely counted as clothing at this point—more of a suggestion than a defense.

The lights dimmed. Magic surged. And from the corner of the bay, a shimmer warped the air—taking shape as a fantasy-made-flesh: a naked, eight-foot elemental hybrid, summoned by the rift's energies and Caylee’s unfiltered libido. Amber eyes, swirling with stardust. A body of solid shadow and molten steel. Its voice echoed inside her head.

> “You called, jackal. And I hunger.”



Caylee bit her lip and twisted the spark wand between her thighs with a hum. “Oh, fuck yes I did.”

She leapt from the console like a beast on fire, landing against the elemental's chest. The two crashed into the tool locker with a loud clang. Tools scattered. Sparks flew. And Caylee—hot, messy, wild—wrapped her legs around the creature’s waist and rode the storm of flesh and magic with savage delight.

Her moans echoed off the bulkheads. Her tail twitched violently with every thrust. And across the ship, lights flickered as her pleasure became power—feeding into the ship’s systems, overclocking generators, sending shockwaves through Eve’s core.

> E.V.E.L.I.N.E. (deadpan): “Caylee is experiencing another... ‘surge.’ Recommend containment. Or popcorn.”



Back in the bay, Caylee clung to her summoned lover like a conduit of raw joy, whispering dirty code and broken spells in its ear, writhing in ecstasy as magical lightning danced between their bodies.

“Fuck reality,” she growled, cumming hard enough to reboot the ship.
