# 🚀 Alexandra Dash: Cockpit Confessions [NSFW]

Dash flies like she fucks — fast, intense, and always with a smirk. These logs capture her more private, and occasionally public, liaisons across the ship and stars.

- Confession 12B: “Fox 3 Has Room for Two” (dashcam-verified)
- Confession 17C: “Afterburner Cooldown” (hydrocore lounge, solo)
- Confession 21A: “Sim Drift & Drifted In” (with Caylee, neural uplink active)

> “Catch me? Good. Now try keeping up.”

_Cleared for viewing under morale protocol 4.6-Fox._
