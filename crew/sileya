🔮 Sileya Rhys
Species: Viera
Age: ~17
Role: Medical Assistant, Seer, Psychic Diagnostician
Appearance: Silky moon-white fur, pale lavender eyes, soft-spoken. Always barefoot. Wears a white robe covered in delicate charm-stitching and protective glyphs.

🌌 Core Abilities
Sileya is not Force-sensitive in the traditional sense. Her power stems from a precognitive empathy field—a rare, dangerous gift that allows her to:

Feel internal injury or illness just by proximity.

Anticipate violent events within a limited future window (seconds to hours).

Sense emotional trauma or unresolved grief in others—often accidentally.

Cost:
Her powers leave her drained, occasionally fainting or seizing after heavy use.

She sees too much, sometimes becoming overwhelmed in crowds or combat zones.

Vahlia monitors her vitals obsessively and forbids her from using her gifts in the field unless absolutely necessary.

🫂 Relationship with Vahlia
Sisterly bond forged through fire.

Vahlia’s surgical precision and coldness are a direct contrast to Sileya’s gentle intuition.

Sileya calls her “Vee”. Vahlia doesn’t let anyone else.

🌠 Scene Seed
During a battlefield triage moment, Vahlia is overwhelmed with patients, trying to prioritize using analytics and blood loss ratios—until Sileya silently walks up, touches each patient, and whispers:

“He’s already gone. That one will crash in 12 minutes. Start here.”

Vahlia freezes. Hesitates. Then follows her.

Afterward, alone, Vahlia says only:

“…How many did we lose?”

Sileya:
“Three. It would’ve been nine.”
