🧬 Origin Story
Born on the orbital salvage ring Jetta-Vox, Dash grew up in zero-g hull crawls, engine fumes, and rustwater bootleggers.

Abandoned young, she was raised by a roaming gang of “Thrashjackers”—vehicle pirates and street racers turned resistance smugglers.

Her first confirmed kill was at 12, sniping a Dominion enforcer from a collapsing scaffolding tower.

She left the gang when they took a job trafficking Veil-sensitive children—torched their ship mid-heist, then went solo.

🛸 Joining The Last Centurion
Dash answered a falsified bounty contract—hired to steal a shuttle from the Centurion’s flight deck, believing the ship was abandoned.

Eve spotted her instantly. Loona tackled her, and Derrian offered her a job mid-beating.

She accepted with a bloody grin, stole Eve’s backup shuttle within the week as a prank, and became irreplaceable by month’s end.

🔫 Gear & Mods
“Stinger”: Her custom sniper rifle, built with magnetic stabilization coils, pulse-breath sync scope, and a suppressor long enough to use as a melee club.

Pilot Suit: Tight-weave exoskin flight suit with kinetic dampeners and heat-shield vent plating.

Visor Implant: Retina overlay HUD with distance triangulation, comms routing, and augmented targeting.

Grav Boots: Allow for short aerial dashes and wall-walking in tight spots.

Personal Vehicle: Keeps a custom hoverbike called The Wubbeast in Bay 5—glows with rainbow plasma trails.

🫂 Crew Relationships
Derrian Wolfe
She respects him like a weird hot uncle. Flirts to make him uncomfortable.

Pretends not to believe in the Force, but once saw him break a man with his mind and shut up fast.

Loona
Mutual respect, occasional bickering. Dash thinks Loona is “the hot murder mom” and Loona secretly appreciates the chaos Dash brings.

Loona once saved her from a decompression chamber—they don’t talk about it, but Dash gave her a new set of bike grips after.

Eve
Dash adores antagonizing Eve.

They’ve developed a kind of playful hacker rivalry. Dash once renamed all of Eve’s avatar units “Dashlets” for 3 days.

Eve retaliated by trapping Dash in a full-sensory hologram of her most embarrassing childhood memory.

🔐 Secrets and Plot Hooks
Dash’s bloodwork matches a long-lost line of Veil-touched scouts, though she denies any Force connection. She might be latent.

Her rainbow pattern isn't natural—it’s the result of genetic spillover from a failed stealth experiment.

She’s wanted by the Corsair Drift, a syndicate she ghosted mid-heist.

Dash has a “getaway file” locked in her bike—coordinates, credits, ID wipes. No one knows, but she keeps it updated just in case.
