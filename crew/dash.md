## 🛬 Background & Origin

Dash grew up on a scrapper station orbiting a war-blasted moon. No formal education, but she learned engineering from smugglers and physics from falling off rooftops. She built her first bike at age 9. Stole her first ship at 13. Never looked back.

She’s run with pirates, rebels, couriers, and gunrunners. But she joined *The Last Centurion* for the one thing none of them had: trust.

## 🚀 Why She’s Aboard

Wolfe needed a pilot who could outmaneuver starfighters and outshoot commandos. Dash volunteered… before he even asked. She’s not in it for the cause. She’s in it for the speed, the chaos, and the family she found in the hangar bay.

## 🤝 Relationships On Board

- **Derrian Wolfe:** Father-figure energy. She respects him, but loves poking at his seriousness.

- **Loona Virex:** Tactical trust. Mutual eye-rolls. The kind of bond built by bleeding side by side.

- **Caylee Jay:** Besties with wrench access. Dash taught Caylee how to drift the cargo freighter once. It… didn’t go great.

- **Seraphim Katt:** They party, they dare, they flirt like they’ll never get caught. Dash sees the broken edges in her—never mentions them.

- **Eve:** They argue constantly. Dash treats her like a person; Eve insists she’s a system. No one wins.

## 🧩 Secrets, Hooks & Plot Seeds

- Dash once worked for a cartel called **Lumen Coil**—they branded her for desertion. She keeps the scar hidden.

- She’s building a secret bike in the back of the engineering bay. It runs on parts Caylee doesn’t even know are missing.

- There’s a bounty on her head… in four systems. She’s almost proud of that.
