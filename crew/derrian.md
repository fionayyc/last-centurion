## 🧬 Background & Origin

Derrian Wolfe was born on a frontier world lost in the Rift Wars. Recruited into the Force Order early, he was never fully aligned with their teachings. He survived the fall of the order, escaped the Dominion, and carved his path through warzones, underworlds, and black ops projects until he found something worth leading—a ship with a soul, and a crew that could become more.

## 🚀 Why He’s Aboard

He commands *The Last Centurion* not out of pride—but out of duty. The galaxy is fracturing, and he refuses to let his people become casualties of someone else's empire again. He leads from the front, even if it costs him everything.

## 🤝 Relationships On Board

- **Loona Virex:** Volatile history. Former lovers. Mutual respect wrapped in sharp tension. She's his blade, even when she cuts too close.

- **Seraphim Katt:** He sees through her masks, but not always through her eyes. He respects her skill and distrusts her methods.

- **Sierra:** Believes she underestimates what she can't measure. She thinks he overestimates what he can't prove. It’s a standstill… for now.

- **Caylee Jay:** A walking hazard—but one he’s proud of. He trusts her with the ship more than anyone else.

- **Eve:** The AI he helped install has changed—and he’s not sure if that’s a miracle or a warning.

## 🧩 Secrets, Hooks & Plot Seeds

- Derrian’s lightsaber was once red. It changed after he abandoned a dark path—one that still calls to him in dreams.

- He’s being hunted by a Force-wraith known as **The Hollowed Flame**, who claims Derrian stole his destiny.

- The Last Centurion wasn’t his first command. His last ship was destroyed under suspicious circumstances—and he’s never spoken of it.
