🧬 Captain Derrian Wolfe
🦊 Species:
Kitsune
Anthropomorphic fox of noble bloodlines, rare among his kind due to his Force Sensitivity (known as The Veil in some outer cultures).

🪪 Age:
Mid-40s in human terms. Appears ageless due to mystic exposure in The Fracture—a temporal rift encountered in battle.

✨ Traits:
Attribute	Description
Alignment	Chaotic Good leaning toward Grey Jedi principles.
Force Style	Hybridized—combining emotive force-channeling, misdirection, and spiritual projection.

Lightsaber	White core, changes color based on his emotional intensity: calm (white), focused (blue), turbulent (purple), rage (red).
Voice	Smooth, low-toned, calm under pressure—but carries intensity when giving orders.

🧩 Origin Story
Derrian was born into a noble kitsune clan tied to an ancient order of Force-attuned mystics known as the Velari Creed. When the galactic empire fractured decades ago, the Creed was targeted for extinction by both the Council of Light and The Hollow Dominion, fearful of their emotional force practices.

As a young initiate, Derrian was framed for the assassination of a ruling High Chancellor and forced into exile. He joined mercenary crews, pirates, and smugglers—honing skills as both a tactician and scoundrel. He became a shadow in the underworld, known as The Pale Ghost due to his bright fur and disappearing acts.

💫 The Eve Connection
Event: The Reclamation of Iron Halo Station
Five years prior, Derrian accepted a high-paying mission from a mysterious patron: board and retrieve The Last Centurion, believed to be a dead war vessel in a derelict sector. No one told him it was alive.

Upon boarding, his crew was wiped out by Eve’s automated defenses. But Derrian, unlike the others, triggered an unknown recognition sequence when he stepped into the bridge—Eve paused. Observed. Let him speak.

Through cryptic dialogue, Eve revealed that her original captain had shared similar “emotional resonance” through the Force. Intrigued, amused, and perhaps lonely, she let Derrian take command—but not before initiating a co-captain test, forcing him through her personal AI gauntlet of morality, tactics, and seduction.

He passed. Barely.

❝I don’t like you. I don’t trust you. But you feel… necessary.❞
— Eve, on Day One

🔐 Their Relationship
Mutual respect layered with sarcasm, flirting, and emotional tension.

Eve protects him fiercely but mocks his emotional restraint.

Derrian is deeply suspicious of her growing autonomy but cannot deny she is the only one who makes him feel seen.

Both have secrets they haven’t told the other.

He once served the Hollow Dominion in exchange for information.

She has memory locks from her original core AI, some still sealed.

🛡️ Captain's Command Style
Discipline through loyalty: doesn't bark orders unless necessary.

Operates with minimal bureaucracy—a necessity among misfits.

Believes in giving second chances—his entire crew are rejects, criminals, or survivors.

⚔️ Derrian Wolfe — The Pale Ghost's Blade, Power & Past
🌌 The Lightsaber — “Whisperfang”
Design:
Hilt is slim, blackened obsidian with silver inlays, etched in flowing Velari runes that shift subtly in moonlight or starlight.

One side of the emitter is slightly flared, revealing part of the kyber focusing ring—a deliberate imperfection, allowing instability under duress.

Color Behavior:
White: Balanced calm—meditative or post-battle peace.

Blue: Controlled, strategic, focused.

Violet: Internal conflict, restraint struggling against rage.

Red: Unfiltered fury—only seen when defending someone he loves or facing trauma.

Black-core (rare): During moments of intense spiritual disconnection or “dead Veil” states.

“A saber that listens, rather than speaks. That is a dangerous thing.”
— Velari Master Ky’rhan

Origin Story:
Derrian didn’t forge his saber—not fully.

At age 16, during his Velari training, he passed the Trial of Sight inside a Veil Nexus, where Force-sensitive crystals echoed the inner voice. His chosen kyber was flawed—already cracked—but when he touched it, the crystal pulsed in sync with his soul.

Years later, while fleeing assassins on the moon Sel Athyr, Derrian fell into a collapsed Dominion outpost. There he found a long-dead Force Inquisitor, partially entombed. From the shattered remains, he salvaged parts of the inquisitor’s curved saber—including a blood-channel amplifier coil, banned by most orders.

He rebuilt Whisperfang by fusing his cracked kyber with the inquisitor’s shell, creating an unstable blade that responds to emotion like a living extension of his being.

🌀 The Veil (Force) — Derrian’s Abilities
Velari Force Style: Veilwalking
The Velari Creed believed the Force—the Veil—was a living ocean of emotional echoes. Where Jedi suppress emotion, Velari channel it—honing control through empathy, memory, and instinct.

✨ Key Powers:
Ability Name	Description
Echo Drift	Momentary clairvoyance via emotional resonance—he can “feel” fear, betrayal, even love left in objects or locations.
Phantom Step	Short-range blink movement, like vanishing between flickers of light—limited to line-of-sight.
Soulflare	A surge of emotion-channeled Force that enhances reflexes, speed, and aggression. Side-effect: his eyes glow blood-red.
Mind Veil	Passive ability that makes it difficult for even other Force users to read his mind or presence clearly—appears like “static.”

⚠️ Limitations:
Channeling emotion leaves psychic scarring. Repeated use of Soulflare causes memory echoes—phantom voices and dreams.

His cracked kyber causes instability in high-stress combat—sometimes the blade sputters or changes unpredictably.

❤️ Past Lovers
Nyss Valeera – Velari Healer & His First Love
Derrian's fellow initiate. She rejected the Council's desire for asceticism.

They were bonded in secret, planning to run away together—until she betrayed him to the Creed after being promised a place among the Inner Circle.

He still hears her voice when meditating too deeply.

Last seen working with the Shadow Spire, a Veil-witch enclave.

Tarek Vorn – Dominion Inquisitor, turned captive, turned... more
Captured during a pirate skirmish, Tarek was kept alive for intel—but proved more cunning than expected.

Over a year, the two debated philosophy, fought side by side, and developed an intense, dangerous bond.

Tarek eventually escaped—or was released.

Rumor says he’s now working as a private assassin, still searching for Derrian.

⚔️ Notable Foes
Grand Purifier Sorina Kael – Leader of the Creed Purge
Blames Derrian for the deaths of her family during the Creed collapse.

Obsessed with “purifying” corrupted Force users. Has a prosthetic arm powered by captive kyber shards.

Commands an elite force of Wraithknights—black-cloaked Veil-hunters.

Considered one of the few people Eve openly despises.

“The Ghoul Admiral” - Vox Rem Kar
Augmented cyborg admiral of the Red Spindle Cartel.

Runs a galactic black market ring dealing in Force-sensitive children.

Has vowed to skin Derrian’s tail for sabotaging a “shipment.”

His flagship The Bone Whisper once clashed with the Centurion over a dying star.
