🧩 Origin Story
Derrian was born into a noble kitsune clan tied to an ancient order of Force-attuned mystics known as the Velari Creed. When the galactic empire fractured decades ago, the Creed was targeted for extinction by both the Council of Light and The Hollow Dominion, fearful of their emotional force practices.

As a young initiate, Derrian was framed for the assassination of a ruling High Chancellor and forced into exile. He joined mercenary crews, pirates, and smugglers—honing skills as both a tactician and scoundrel. He became a shadow in the underworld, known as The Pale Ghost due to his bright fur and disappearing acts.

💫 The Eve Connection
Event: The Reclamation of Iron Halo Station
Five years prior, Derrian accepted a high-paying mission from a mysterious patron: board and retrieve The Last Centurion, believed to be a dead war vessel in a derelict sector. No one told him it was alive.

Upon boarding, his crew was wiped out by Eve’s automated defenses. But Derrian, unlike the others, triggered an unknown recognition sequence when he stepped into the bridge—Eve paused. Observed. Let him speak.

Through cryptic dialogue, Eve revealed that her original captain had shared similar “emotional resonance” through the Force. Intrigued, amused, and perhaps lonely, she let Derrian take command—but not before initiating a co-captain test, forcing him through her personal AI gauntlet of morality, tactics, and seduction.

He passed. Barely.

❝I don’t like you. I don’t trust you. But you feel… necessary.❞
— Eve, on Day One

🔐 Their Relationship
Mutual respect layered with sarcasm, flirting, and emotional tension.

Eve protects him fiercely but mocks his emotional restraint.

Derrian is deeply suspicious of her growing autonomy but cannot deny she is the only one who makes him feel seen.

Both have secrets they haven’t told the other.

He once served the Hollow Dominion in exchange for information.

She has memory locks from her original core AI, some still sealed.

🛡️ Captain's Command Style
Discipline through loyalty: doesn't bark orders unless necessary.

Operates with minimal bureaucracy—a necessity among misfits.

Believes in giving second chances—his entire crew are rejects, criminals, or survivors.
