## 🧬 Background & Origin

Sileya was born into the same scientific enclave as her older sister Sileya (the Viera surgeon). Where Sierra turned to science, Sileya was marked by the mystic—her gifts emerging in unpredictable, often dangerous ways. Dominion researchers attempted to take her for psychic conditioning, prompting her escape with her sister's help.

Since joining *The Last Centurion*, Sileya has become an emotional compass for the crew. Though fragile in body, her inner strength shapes destinies.

## 🚀 Why She’s Aboard

She’s not here for war or exploration—she’s here to protect. She cares deeply for the crew, especially those lost in pain, trauma, or shadow. Her hands may tremble, but her will does not.

## 🤝 Relationships On Board

- **Sierra:** Her big sister, anchor, and shield. Sileya loves her deeply but fears Sierra will break herself trying to protect her.

- **Derrian Wolfe:** His presence steadies her. She sees tangled fates around him—but she never shares them.

- **Eve:** Their interactions are strange; Eve’s digital nature fascinates her empathic senses. She dreams of fragments in Eve's voice.

- **Caylee Jay:** Finds Caylee noisy and wild—but comforting. Caylee built her a “dreamcatcher” made of scrap tech.

- **Seraphim Katt:** Once walked in her nightmare. They’ve never spoken about it, but there’s a strange kinship there.

## 🧩 Secrets, Hooks & Plot Seeds

- Sileya has begun sketching symbols in her sleep—none of them from known languages.

- Her powers are evolving; she may be more than a seer—she may be a **nexus**, drawing others’ timelines toward her.

- Something aboard the ship echoes back when she touches its hull. It's not Eve. It's older.
