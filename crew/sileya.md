## 🧠 Personality Snapshot

Sileya is brilliance wrapped in cynicism. A combat-hardened trauma surgeon, she doesn't believe in the Force or fate—only science, pain, and survival. She's fiercely protective of her little sister Veyla, and her cold demeanor masks a heart that’s long scarred but not beyond hope.

- **Alignment:** Lawful neutral  
- **Tone:** Clinical, sarcastic, occasionally caustic  
- **Belief System:** Pure rationalism, anti-spiritualist  
- **Moral Code:** “Do no harm” does not apply to enemies

> *“Miracles are just science you haven’t reverse-engineered yet.”*

## 🧬 Background & Origin

Before *The Last Centurion*, Sileya served on warfront hospital ships, blacksite clinics, and even Dominion salvage crews. She’s seen the worst of sapient-kind—and expects no better from the next species.

She joined Derrian’s crew only after Veyla fled to it. She didn’t trust anyone else to protect her sister, so she volunteered… then seized control of the medbay like she owned the ship.

## 🚀 Why She’s Aboard

She’s here for one reason: Veyla. But over time, Sileya has found a strange kind of purpose on *The Last Centurion*—a mobile sanctuary for broken people trying to become whole.

She won’t admit it… but she’s beginning to care.

## 🤝 Relationships On Board

- **Veyla:** Her younger sister, her reason for breathing, and the only person who sees past her armor.

- **Sierra:** Intellectually fascinating. Annoyingly mystical. Respects her mind, scorns her beliefs.

- **Derrian Wolfe:** Distrusts his “Force insight” but respects his tactics. They argue often—sometimes productively.

- **Eve:** She treats Eve like an unstable machine. Eve, in return, flirts with her just to get under her skin.

- **Loona:** Mutual soldiers. They don’t talk much—but when they do, it’s blunt and real.

## 🧩 Secrets, Hooks & Plot Seeds

- Sileya once experimented with neural backups—one of them may have gained sentience.

- She’s hiding her own injuries. Her right arm isn’t just cybernetic—it’s host to dormant tech she won’t explain.

- There are sealed logs in her database marked “SYNTH-DAUGHTER.” No one has the clearance to open them.
