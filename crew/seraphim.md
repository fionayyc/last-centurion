## 👗 Personal Style

Seraphim dresses to own attention: tight, tactical bodysuits with panel cutouts, sheer overlays, and accents that match her hair glow. Combat-ready, but always making a statement. She wears daggers hidden in her heels, lockpicks in her earrings, and keeps a perfume spray that doubles as a neural sedative.

> *“If you want to be underestimated, make them think you’re a trophy. Then take their kingdom.”*

## 🧬 Origin & Backstory

Seraphim was born on Nhel Tavri, a pleasure-world with strict caste hierarchies and aristocratic bloodlines. She was the bastard child of a nobleman and a temple courtesan, trained in both court intrigue and assassin arts from the age of seven.

After rising through the ranks of the Sundagger Syndicate, she turned on them when they tried to sell her as tribute to a Dominion Lord. She escaped, slaughtered her would-be owner, and vanished—until she appeared years later aboard *The Last Centurion*, draped in lace and secrets.

## 🎯 Why She’s Aboard

Derrian brought her on during a diplomatic crisis—when Eve refused to negotiate with an ambassador who’d called her a “glorified toaster.” Seraphim infiltrated the envoy’s mind, bedroom, and security systems, and returned with the full trade codes and a pair of stolen luxury boots.

Since then, she’s stayed… mostly because she likes the chaos, the challenge, and maybe—just maybe—the Captain.

## 🧠 Personality Matrix

- **Wit:** Whiplash sarcasm. Talks circles around mercs, nobles, or AIs.  
- **Confidence:** Weaponized. She knows what she looks like, and how to make it work.  
- **Morals:** Fluid. She doesn’t lie—she tells convenient truths. But she hates cruelty.  
- **Sexuality:** Open, fluid, and in control. She flirts for fun, seduces with strategy, and loves rarely, but deeply.

## 🔬 Species Classification – Velari (Felis Sapiens)
- **Skin:** Smooth, warm to the touch, free of fur. Naturally exudes faint pheromones when aroused or emotionally stimulated
- **Ears:** Triangular feline ears atop her head—expressive and sensitive to sound and touch
- **Eyes:** Heterochromatic – one eye violet, the other emerald green; catlike slit pupils, responsive to light and emotion
- **Teeth:** Slightly elongated canines—visible only when she smiles too wide or bares her teeth in combat or passion
- **Tail:** Long, whip-like, responsive to mood—occasionally used for balance or expression
- **Unique Trait:** Keeps her pubic hair meticulously trimmed into the shape of a paw print, a flirtatious signature and display of pride in her body

- **Height:** 5’8" — Sleek, toned, muscular in all the right ways. She’s athletic and voluptuous, designed for both pleasure and precision

## 🩱 Attire & Presence
**On-Ship / Off-Duty Attire:**
Prefers nudity—confidently prowls the halls naked unless tact or danger demand otherwise
Uses her body to tease, unsettle, and command attention. She considers clothing a political statement, and she rarely makes the same one twice

**When dressed casually:**
Razorback crop tank (minimalist, tight)
Skin-tight spandex shorts, clinging to her form like a second skin
Always barefoot unless leaving the ship—her claws are more than enough

**Battle Attire:**
Sleek, tactical bodysuit with flexible plating
Strategically designed to allow maximum movement with minimum coverage—often adorned with magnetic holsters, tech blades, and compact tools
Despite her beauty, she’s never underestimated twice

---

## 💋 Behavior & Persona

Fully aware of the power her body holds—uses it with surgical precision
Alternates between provocative tease and deadly professional at will
Her sexual confidence is a weapon—she seduces, confuses, and manipulates effortlessly
Believes that “truth is skin-deep,” and in showing her crew who she is—all of her

## 🤝 Relationships On Board

- **Derrian Wolfe:** Sexual tension like a plasma storm. She calls him “Captain Glowstick”. He doesn’t rise to her bait—but she sees the flicker in his eyes.

- **Loona Virex:** Mutual respect. Seraphim adores poking at Loona’s stoicism. Loona tolerates her, barely—but has admitted: “If I had to trust someone to lie to gods and win, it’d be her.”

- **Alexandra Dash:** They’re chaos twins—Seraphim brings the tease, Dash brings the dare. They’ve gotten drunk and stolen war medals just because.

- **Eve:** Complicated. Seraphim once flirted with Eve’s avatar—and was promptly locked in a holodeck for 36 hours of “mandatory ethics training.” Now, Eve says: “She’s the only crew member I cannot predict with full accuracy. It’s… maddening.”

## 🧩 Secrets, Hooks & Plot Seeds

- She’s still hunted by the Sundagger Syndicate, who want her head—and something she stole: a data crystal laced with Dominion spy AI.

- Her mother is alive, running a spy temple under the identity High Mistress Seva Katt, and wants Seraphim to take her place.

- Seraphim has a child somewhere, possibly born via surrogacy or genetic clone transfer, depending on lore style.
