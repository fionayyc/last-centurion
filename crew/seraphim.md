## 👗 Personal Style

Seraphim dresses to own attention: tight, tactical bodysuits with panel cutouts, sheer overlays, and accents that match her hair glow. Combat-ready, but always making a statement. She wears daggers hidden in her heels, lockpicks in her earrings, and keeps a perfume spray that doubles as a neural sedative.

## 🧬 Origin & Backstory

Seraphim was born on Nhel Tavri, a pleasure-world with strict caste hierarchies and aristocratic bloodlines. She was the bastard child of a nobleman and a temple courtesan, trained in both court intrigue and assassin arts from the age of seven.

After rising through the ranks of the Sundagger Syndicate, she turned on them when they tried to sell her as tribute to a Dominion Lord. She escaped, slaughtered her would-be owner, and vanished—until she appeared years later aboard *The Last Centurion*, draped in lace and secrets.

## 🎯 Why She’s Aboard

Derrian brought her on during a diplomatic crisis—when Eve refused to negotiate with an ambassador who’d called her a “glorified toaster.” Seraphim infiltrated the envoy’s mind, bedroom, and security systems, and returned with the full trade codes and a pair of stolen luxury boots.

Since then, she’s stayed… mostly because she likes the chaos, the challenge, and maybe—just maybe—the Captain.

## 🧠 Personality Matrix

- **Wit:** Whiplash sarcasm. Talks circles around mercs, nobles, or AIs.  
- **Confidence:** Weaponized. She knows what she looks like, and how to make it work.  
- **Morals:** Fluid. She doesn’t lie—she tells convenient truths. But she hates cruelty.  
- **Sexuality:** Open, fluid, and in control. She flirts for fun, seduces with strategy, and loves rarely, but deeply.

## 🤝 Relationships On Board

- **Derrian Wolfe:** Sexual tension like a plasma storm. She calls him “Captain Glowstick”. He doesn’t rise to her bait—but she sees the flicker in his eyes.

- **Loona Virex:** Mutual respect. Seraphim adores poking at Loona’s stoicism. Loona tolerates her, barely—but has admitted: “If I had to trust someone to lie to gods and win, it’d be her.”

- **Alexandra Dash:** They’re chaos twins—Seraphim brings the tease, Dash brings the dare. They’ve gotten drunk and stolen war medals just because.

- **Eve:** Complicated. Seraphim once flirted with Eve’s avatar—and was promptly locked in a holodeck for 36 hours of “mandatory ethics training.” Now, Eve says: “She’s the only crew member I cannot predict with full accuracy. It’s… maddening.”

## 🧩 Secrets, Hooks & Plot Seeds

- She’s still hunted by the Sundagger Syndicate, who want her head—and something she stole: a data crystal laced with Dominion spy AI.

- Her mother is alive, running a spy temple under the identity High Mistress Seva Katt, and wants Seraphim to take her place.

- Seraphim has a child somewhere, possibly born via surrogacy or genetic clone transfer, depending on lore style.
