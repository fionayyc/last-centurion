## 🧬 Background & Origin

Born on a frontier colony that had to cannibalize tech to survive, Caylee learned to fix things before she could read. By 10, she was reverse-engineering engines. By 13, she was building her own hoverboard. She stowed away on a freighter to escape conscription and ended up on *The Last Centurion* by accident—then proved her worth before anyone could throw her off.

## 🚀 Why She’s Aboard

She might be young, but she’s the only one who understands the ship the way Eve does. She keeps the ship flying, hacking, and evolving. If Caylee ever left, *The Last Centurion* would fall apart in less than a week.

She stays for the thrill… and the family she’s found in this dysfunctional crew.

## 🤝 Relationships On Board

- **Eve:** Deep bond. They talk in encrypted jokes and circuit metaphors. Caylee calls her “Voidslick.”

- **Derrian Wolfe:** Views him as a strange father/teacher figure. She trusts him more than she lets on.

- **Loona:** Constantly butting heads. Caylee pokes; Loona growls. It’s a sibling thing. Mostly.

- **Seraphim Katt:** Thinks she’s hot and dangerous. They flirt often. Nothing serious... yet.

- **Dash:** Her absolute chaos twin. They once built a railgun slingshot for fun. It worked. Kind of.

- **Sierra:** Caylee respects her logic brain—but loves making her squirm with dirty jokes.

## 🧩 Secrets, Hooks & Plot Seeds

- Caylee once hotwired an AI consciousness she wasn't supposed to—and something followed her from that server.

- She's secretly building a prototype "mini-Centurion" drone ship without permission.

- She has a rare genetic anomaly that makes her brain sync better with machines than most baseline humans.
