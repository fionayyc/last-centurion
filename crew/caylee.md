🛠️ Caylee Jay
Species: Anthropomorphic Jackal
Fur: Sandy gold with black-tipped ears and tail
Eyes: Bright green, always a little dilated—intensity or too much stim-caff, no one’s sure
Age: 16 (chronologically); mentally and technically light-years ahead
Role: Chief Engineer, Gadgeteer, Ship-Tinkerer, Eve’s unauthorized “intern”

🔧 Overview
Caylee is a natural-born technopath. Not Force-sensitive, but something about her instincts borders on supernatural when it comes to machinery. She can make an FTL core sing, jury-rig a drone army from trash, or reprogram a Dominion turret with a hairpin, a candy wrapper, and two fingers.

She talks fast, works faster, and leaves chaos in her wake—but the ship runs better when she’s around, whether Eve likes it or not.

🧬 Origin Story
Born in a slum factory-vault on Mechara 7, Caylee was the illegitimate child of a black market cybernetics engineer and a former Dominion military AI tech. Her parents were arrested when she was 5. She escaped through the ventilation ducts—and never stopped crawling into machines.

Raised by the “Sprocklets”, a juvenile tech gang who lived inside decommissioned orbital scrapyards, she outbuilt everyone by age 9, including the adult smugglers they worked under.

At 14, she sabotaged a slaver freighter trying to recruit her by rerouting their air system into a sewage loop and launching their jump core through their galley.

Stowed away on The Last Centurion after tracking rumors of “the ship with a living mind.” When discovered, Eve tried to eject her.

Derrian overrode the lockdown and asked her, “Can you fix a Class-V reactor choke coil?”
She replied: “Can I teach it to sing?”

⚙️ Engineering Style
Trait	Description
Tools	Custom-made multiwrench gauntlet, floating repair drone “Zippy”, pulse-torch, anti-grav welder, chewing gum.
Signature Gadgets	Deployable recon orbs, distraction fizzers, portable shield puck, mood-reactive welding goggles.
Modding Habits	Constantly altering ship systems—Eve catches 20% of them. Others run better than specs… or nearly explode.

🧠 Personality
Trait	Description
Social Style	Hyper-chatty, curious, fearless. Swings between genius-level focus and distracted tinker-goblin energy.
Relationships	Everyone protects her—but she doesn't think she needs it. Fiercely independent. Deeply loyal.
Romantic History	Flirted with a Dominion war-clone once during a boarding mission. Eve tried to vaporize him.
Crew Dynamic	Seen as a daughter or little sister by most. Gets away with everything, usually with a grin.

🤖 Relationship with Eve
Contentious, hilarious, and sometimes touching.

Caylee sees Eve as “cool big sister if she were also a scary space god.”

Eve calls her “the Devil Gremlin”, “Monkey Greasepaws”, or “the plague in my circuits”.

Eve has secretly integrated several of Caylee’s mods—but will never admit it.

Eve: “You altered my avatar's gait dynamics.”
Caylee: “She walks sassier now. I consider that a success.”

Eve (later, quietly): “...It does look more confident.”

🕯️ Deeper Notes
Caylee doesn’t know what happened to her parents—she keeps a disassembled comm-signal in a necklace made from heat shielding.

She has a fear of being left behind, masked by constant invention.

Keeps a coded audio log addressed to someone unnamed, possibly a sibling or parent, detailing her adventures.

🧨 Potential Plot Hooks
One of her gadgets malfunctions, awakening something in the bowels of the Centurion.

The Sprocklets reach out—or sell her out—for a bounty.

Eve faces a scenario where she must sacrifice a part of herself to protect Caylee, triggering a motherly override.
