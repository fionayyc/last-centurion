# Sierra

🧬 Lt. Sierra Elaren
Species: Elvari (Elf-analog species; humanoid, long-lived, evolved for high sensory awareness)
Height: 6'3"
Eyes: Pale silver, with shifting iridescence under strong light
Hair: Short-cropped pixie cut, sharp edges, dyed with teal and violet streaks against her natural platinum silver
Ears: Long, elegantly curved, always exposed—do not mistake her for Terran if you enjoy keeping your teeth

🧪 Role & Expertise
Title: Chief Science Officer & Experimental Theorist
Sierra is the crew's lead for:

Xeno-biology

Particle theory

Veil-reaction modeling (Force-aligned phenomena)

Techno-theoretical research (how unknown ancient tech bends physics)

She maintains the Anomaly Lab aboard the Centurion—nicknamed “the ghost cage” by the crew because it buzzes with shielded artifacts, semi-sentient data shards, and occasional Veil echoes.

“Magic is just a system we haven’t mathematically solved yet.”

🧬 Background
Born on the Elvari world of Sorellith, Sierra was raised in an isolated academic enclave of philosopher-scientists who debated metaphysics under starlit canopies and mapped constellations into predictive models. She scored off-the-charts in cognition and pattern theory by age 12, and was recruited into the Arcus Foundation—a think tank tasked with bridging mysticism and quantifiable science.

Sierra eventually left the Foundation, disillusioned with their refusal to test what she called “the heart of divinity”—a term she uses to describe the Force.

After several years as a field researcher, she joined the Centurion for access to anomalies and exposure to Derrian Wolfe—a living contradiction between what can be measured and what cannot.

🎓 Science Meets the Force
Sierra does believe in the Force, but she doesn't worship it. She sees it as a unified field—emotive, conscious, reactive, and possibly quantifiable.

Theory	Description
Resonant Will Field Theory	The Force is a responsive energetic field shaped by sentient minds. Stronger minds = stronger ripples.
Veil Entanglement Hypothesis	“Visions” and “telekinesis” are entangled quantum states interpreted by conscious thought.
Force-Stasis Conflict Model	Suggests that resisting emotion builds instability, while channeling it (Velari-style) aligns internal state with external flow.

🩺 Personality & Style
Trait	Description
Temperament	Calm, poised, precise—but will debate to the death.
Social Habits	Rarely parties. Deep one-on-one conversationalist. Loves personal puzzles.
Appearance	Always dresses in streamlined silver suits, usually form-fitting, highlighted with glowing teal and violet striping. Often mistaken for a priestess. She corrects them. Coldly.
Quirk	Wears ear-jewels coded to pulse with proximity to unknown energy fields. Claims it's practical. It’s also beautiful.

🛸 Crew Dynamics
Derrian Wolfe: Fascinated by him. Constantly tests him with questions and field scans. They argue about destiny daily. They may have kissed once during a solar storm while cloaked. Neither talks about it.

Sileya (psychic nurse): Respects her deeply. Often studies her precognition. Protects her like a niece.

Vahlia (medic): Intellectual tension. They disagree on metaphysics but work flawlessly together in crisis.

Seraphim: The two are oddly close—Seraphim teases her, Sierra pretends to ignore it. Their private chess matches have turned into veiled flirtations with probability spikes.

🌌 Secrets & Plot Hooks
Sierra may have encountered a precursor Force-aligned AI—and is trying to rebuild it in secret.

Her mother disappeared decades ago on a Veil-rich planet. Her search continues, quietly.

She’s begun receiving dreams… not her own. Veil echoes? Or something deeper?
