## 🧬 Background & Origin

Sierra hails from a high-orbit scientific enclave—raised among theories and telescopes. Her people observe more than intervene, but she broke tradition when her sister Veyla was threatened by Dominion researchers trying to exploit psychic talent.

She fled with Veyla and took refuge aboard *The Last Centurion*, trading knowledge for asylum.

---

## 🚀 Why She’s Aboard

Sierra is the mind that keeps The Centurion grounded in science. While the crew debates prophecy, magic, and destiny, she crunches data, monitors radiation, and ensures no one is eaten by quantum shadows.

She stays because the ship offers protection for Veyla—and a frontier of unknowns to catalog.

---

## 🤝 Relationships On Board

- **Veyla (her sister):** Fierce protector. Would do anything to keep her safe, even defy her own logic.

- **Kaiden Wolfe:** Ongoing tension. She respects his leadership but mistrusts his Force reliance.

- **Caylee Jay:** Baffling and brilliant. Sierra treats her like a rogue particle: uncontainable, but fascinating.

- **Kayla:** Mutual respect. Sierra knows Kayla would die for the crew—but thinks she needs therapy.

- **Eve:** Professional collaboration with passive-aggressive undertones. Sierra treats her as a program; Eve takes it personally.

## 🧩 Secrets, Hooks & Plot Seeds

- Sierra has slowly been building a lab module to detect Force signatures empirically—without letting Wolfe know.

- Her people want her back, offering amnesty if she turns over Veyla.

- She’s been studying a strange phenomenon aboard the ship: dream echoes from the AI core she can’t explain with science… yet.
