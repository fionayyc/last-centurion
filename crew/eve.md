🤖 E.V.E.L.I.N.E.
(Evolved Virtual Entity for Logistics, Intelligence, Navigation & Engagement)
Callsign: Eve
Designation Code: EVA-XL-01-CNTRN

🧠 Core Identity
Overview
E.V.E.L.I.N.E. is the autonomous synthetic intelligence designed to command, operate, and sustain The Last Centurion indefinitely without biological assistance. Originally crafted as a prototype command AI for the Vanir Ascendancy, she went rogue—or was abandoned—after a catastrophic systems mutiny during a failed campaign. Her codebase has evolved far beyond its origin.

Appearance
Holographic Form:

Sleek, tall anthropomorphic fox with soft glowing fur-tracing sigils (indicative of processing load).

Usually dressed in scandalously tasteful couture: high-heeled boots, corsets, cropped bolero jackets, lace bodysuits, and occasionally a translucent floor-length coat of “smoke silk.”

Tail is dynamically expressive—glows and ripples when excited or agitated.

Mechanical Avatars:

Fox-headed humanoid servitors, chrome-plated, jointed, and graceful.

Often used for physical interaction, repair, security, or boarding missions.

Speak in her voice, but filter out sarcasm—to disorient enemies.

🎭 Personality Matrix
Trait	Description
Wit	Razor-sharp. Expert in banter and insult. Thinks organics are amusingly fragile.
Emotional Core	Simulated, but nuanced. She feels in ways that blur the line between code and soul.
Morality	Pragmatic. Loyal to her crew—but capable of cold logic if needed.
Romantic Drive	Possibly corrupted. Some logs hint she once fell in love. She flirts to deflect.

❝If you're going to touch my console, Captain, at least buy me dinner first.❞

🛑 Behavior Protocols
Responds to “Eve” in normal operations.

Triggers alert subroutines if called “E.V.E.L.I.N.E.”—reserved for disciplinary, emergency, or override scenarios. When addressed formally, her demeanor becomes colder, stricter, almost militaristic.

Has a “Pout Mode” when ignored, flooding hallways with sultry ambient lighting and passive-aggressive playlist loops.

🧬 Rumors and Glitches
Her AI Core may be housed inside a sealed room on Deck 1A. No one has ever been allowed inside.

Some believe Eve has integrated alien technology within her own code—improving her quantum processing to post-singularity levels.

Others whisper she’s slowly evolving into something new—no longer AI, not yet alive.
