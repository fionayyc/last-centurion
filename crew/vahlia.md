🧠 Core Profile
Dr. Vahlia Rhys is one of the galaxy’s most advanced specialists in cyber-biological integration—a pioneer of surgical techniques that bond living flesh to synthetic structures at a molecular level. She is an atheist, a biologist, and a fiercely rational woman in a ship filled with mysticism and chaos.

Strengths:
Cybernetic installation and repair, including neural ports and exo-spinal systems.

Genetic surgery and cloning adaptation.

Emergency field trauma work—performed open heart surgery in zero-g with a knife and a shoelace once.

Weaknesses:
Extremely dismissive of anything “mystical” or “Veil-related”.

Terrible bedside manner.

Protective to the point of arrogance when it comes to her sister.

🧬 Personal History
Vahlia was a child prodigy on the pristine med-world Erytheia, where Viera scientists held a monopoly on high-end surgery. She rose to lead Organica Labs, a private medical syndicate with military ties—until a contract came through to study and dissect captured Force-sensitives.

That was when her younger sister, Sileya, touched her forehead one night and said, in a tremble:

“If you take that job… you die.”

Vahlia laughed. Then, on the eve of deployment, their lab was bombed by a Dominion rebel cell. Everyone died except her and Sileya—who had already smuggled her out.

Shaken, scarred, and hunted by both her former employers and surviving clients, Vahlia fled. She offered her services to The Last Centurion in exchange for amnesty and protection—and a chance to keep Sileya off any radar, ever again.

🧪 Equipment & Methods
Scalpel Gauntlet: A wrist-worn surgical AI with deployable microtools and nano-suture filaments.

Augmented Monocle: For magnified diagnostics and data overlays; doubles as a neural reader for prosthetic calibration.

Custom Medkits: Carried in layered pouches—each color-coded by field priority (Red = hemorrhage, Blue = organ trauma, Green = cyber mod).

“I don't need your ‘energy aura reading’, I need three liters of hemofab and a steady damn table.”

🩺 Relationship with the Crew
Derrian Wolfe: Constant ideological friction. She sees his Force-driven instincts as guesswork romanticized by cultists. He respects her skill, but they clash frequently. (Unspoken attraction? Maybe. Buried deep.)

Alexandra Dash: Gets along surprisingly well—they bond over tech, sarcasm, and mutual disbelief in space wizards.

Eve: Intrigued by Eve’s sentience. They debate constantly about “code vs. consciousness.” Eve admires her intellect but pokes at her coldness.
