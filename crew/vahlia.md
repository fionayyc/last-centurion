- **Alignment:** Neutral good  
- **Tone:** Gentle, intense, occasionally cryptic  
- **Psychic Profile:** Touch-based diagnostic empathy, precognitive spikes  
- **Mental Health:** Monitored closely by Sierra, due to bleedover from crew trauma

## 🧬 Background & Origin

Born in the same enclave as her sister Sierra, Vahlia was identified early as a psychic anomaly. Dominion agents tried to claim her for experimentation; Sierra risked everything to flee with her. Since then, Veyla has lived in near-constant shielding—both physical and psychic.

She’s chosen to remain on *The Last Centurion* because, for once, the future isn’t just something to fear—it’s something to protect.

## 🚀 Why She’s Aboard

She stabilizes the crew not just medically, but emotionally. She brings foresight, comfort, and a strange kind of sacred presence to the ship. Veyla might not carry weapons, but every member of the crew would go to war to defend her.

## 🤝 Relationships On Board

- **Sierra:** Her older sister, protector, and only anchor in the darkest storms.

- **Kaiden Wolfe:** She trusts his presence—his Force harmonizes strangely with her gifts.

- **Eve:** They don’t speak often… but Veyla *knows* when Eve is near, and Eve has begun to ask her questions no AI should know to ask.

- **Caylee Jay:** They’re friends, in a weird misfit way. Caylee built her a music cube that adapts to her neural rhythms.

- **Seraphim Katt:** Veyla once read something in her past that made her cry. She’s never told Seraphim what it was.

## 🧩 Secrets, Hooks & Plot Seeds

- Veyla’s empathy is beginning to reach beyond the ship—she dreams of strangers, of events not yet triggered.

- Dominion psionic trackers are still trying to locate her; her aura occasionally pings hidden satellites.

- She may not be just psychic—there are signs she’s connected to *something older*, buried deep in Riftspace.
