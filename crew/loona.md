## 🧬 Background & Origin

Loona was vat-grown in a Dominion lab, designed as a Hellhound-class shock trooper for boarding operations. She killed her handlers at age 13 and led a rebellion that left one known clone-rival unaccounted for. After that, she spent years in underground mercenary groups before joining Wolfe’s cause.

The Captain offered her something no one else had: a command.

---

## 🎯 Why She’s Aboard

Wolfe doesn’t need muscle. He needs someone who can *think like a war criminal but fight like a guardian*. Loona fits that rare mold—an XO who will never ask someone to do what she wouldn’t do herself.

She also ensures that nobody—including Seraphim—gets too close without proving themselves.

## 🤝 Relationships On Board

- **Derrian Wolfe:** Loyal, protective, and maybe still in love. Neither talks about it.

- **Seraphim Katt:** Constant tension. Loona finds her dangerous—but admits she’s useful when deployed properly.

- **Caylee Jay:** Drives her crazy. In a sibling kind of way. She’d die for her… but also strangle her.

- **Alexandra Dash:** Trusts her in the field. Thinks she talks too much. Knows she’ll never miss a shot.

- **Eve:** Loona doesn’t trust AI. Period. But she respects Eve’s cold efficiency.

## 🧩 Secrets, Hooks & Plot Seeds

- Loona’s clone-rival—nicknamed **Ash Fang**—is still alive, possibly hunting her or infiltrating another crew.

- Her body still houses Dominion-implanted hardware, and it's waking up. Nightmares… or something worse.

- She once led a massacre she was ordered to carry out. Only Derrian knows the full truth—and keeps her secret sealed in Eve’s black box.
