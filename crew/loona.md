# Loona

![Loona](../assets/loona.jpg)

🔥 First Officer Loona Virex
Race: Hellhound Anthromorph
Species Traits: Enhanced strength, heat resistance, infrared vision, minor regenerative capabilities.
Age: Appears ~30s in human terms. Actual age unclear—"older than she looks, younger than your funeral" is her standard answer.

💼 Role & Responsibilities
As First Officer, Loona serves as:

XO (Executive Officer) on The Last Centurion.

Tactical Operations Commander – plans boarding missions, skirmish strategy, and precision retrieval ops.

Disciplinary lead – feared and respected by the misfit crew.

Mission clean-up expert – when things go sideways, Loona goes in.

She is direct, unsentimental, and mercilessly competent, handling the business of war and shadow runs while Derrian handles politics, diplomacy, and the Veil.

🪖 Combat Profile
Weapon	Description
"Embercleave"	A customized combat scythe forged from meteoric alloy and fitted with blazing plasma-edge nodes along the crescent blade. Can toggle between a full quarterstaff mode or scythe form. Stored collapsed magnetically on her back.
"Roarhawk" Rifle	Modified mid-range blaster rifle, with triple-barrel rotary burst and underbarrel smart grenade launcher. High energy discharge, fast cooling.
Hand Weapons	Carries ion-daggers in her boots for zero-g grappling or anti-droid assassination work.
Body Mod	Optional thermal exhaust array behind shoulders (can vent heat, create flare flashes or smoke clouds).

“You're loud, clumsy, and slow. I’ve killed faster things by sneezing.”
—Loona, to a rookie during boarding drills

🎭 Personality
Trait	Description
Temperament	Controlled. She can rage, but prefers cold efficiency.
Loyalty	Unshakable toward Derrian—saved her life on a black site op.
Social Habits	Doesn't drink much, but runs illegal sparring bets in the lower gym.
Love Life	Complicated. Known to enjoy physicality, but has deep intimacy walls.
Crew Interaction	Half the crew fears her, the other half wants her approval (or attention).

She has an unspoken code: strength over words, action over noise. But beneath her stoic armor is a being haunted by wars, betrayals, and possibly genetic experiments.

🔥 Origin File – CLASSIFIED (Decrypted)
Born on the industrial smog-world Korrith-9, in the Shatterblack Spires—home of military cloning projects and rogue biotech labs.

Part of the Cerberan Experiment, designed to produce tactical leadership combat clones with hellhound DNA spliced with shock trooper conditioning.

She escaped during a facility meltdown that she may have caused.

Met Derrian while working black ops retrieval for the Crimson Pact. They bonded over a job gone wrong—and stayed together when he took the Centurion.

🤖 Relationship with Eve
Mutual Respect. Eve doesn’t try to flirt with Loona—out of professional admiration… and a small hint of fear.

Loona is the only crew member allowed full tactical override permissions in Eve’s system aside from Derrian.

They’ve saved each other in combat—Eve’s avatars once swarmed a kill zone to extract Loona under heavy fire.

Eve jokingly refers to her as “Firetail One”, much to Loona’s irritation.

🧱 Loona's Secrets and Hooks
Her genetic code is unstable—she may be aging faster than the crew realizes.

There’s a cloaked bounty still out on her, issued by a clan of Syndicate Lords who funded the Cerberan project.

She keeps a black box vault hidden in her quarters—contains something from her pre-Centurion days. Derrian doesn't ask.

❤️ Past Lovers
1. Kaelen Drix – The Flame She Let Burn Out
Species: Human

Occupation: Ex-guild bounty hunter; now presumed dead.

Relationship Summary: Kaelen and Loona met while working opposing retrieval missions on the same backwater moon—ended up teaming up, sharing a kill, and a bed.

They ran together for 14 months, executing high-risk ops for clients too dangerous to name.

Kaelen was the first person who called her out for caring—beneath the armor, he claimed she wanted redemption.

Their relationship ended during a heist gone wrong in the Dresk Core. Kaelen was pinned down, told her to run and finish the job.

She never found a body. Only his blaster scarred and scorched into a bulkhead.

“I’ve loved two things in my life: my rifle, and the woman who stole it the first time we met.”
— Kaelen, in a decrypted message Eve keeps archived (unshared)

She doesn’t talk about him, but cleans her weapons slower on the day of his death each year.

2. Sabris T’rell – The One She Left Behind
Species: Zelvathi (empathic amphibian species)

Occupation: Info-broker, smuggler, blackmailer-for-hire.

Sabris and Loona had a volatile, passionate relationship rooted in danger, sex, and mutual manipulation.

Sabris was capable of feeling Loona’s suppressed emotions—which both intrigued and terrified her.

When Loona joined Derrian aboard The Last Centurion, she vanished without saying goodbye.

Sabris now operates out of the Vinter Coil, a floating black market between gas giant systems.

They’ve had one brush since, across a battlefield—Sabris blew Loona a kiss and walked away under sniper fire.

🗡️ Notable Friendships & Loyalty Bonds
Derrian Wolfe
Their bond is forged in mutual survival.

She would die for him, but also has punched him. Twice.

There’s no romantic history, but they’ve shared a bunk during emergencies, which some crew misread.

He trusts her above all—even to kill him if he loses control of the Veil.

Eve (E.V.E.L.I.N.E.)
Their trust is battle-earned.

Loona has no patience for Eve’s seductive AI antics, but respects her combat intelligence.

Eve once confessed to Derrian:

“She is the only creature aboard this ship who does not see me as either goddess or game. I envy her clarity.”

⚔️ Her Rival: Project Sister - “L13NA” (Liina)
Designation: Cerberan Subject L13NA
Codename: Liina the Paleburn

Clone-sister of Loona—one of the other two surviving subjects from the Cerberan line.

Genetically modified for cold-blooded strategic perfection, Liina lacks Loona’s emotional volatility—but not her combat prowess.

Carries a twin plasma scythe called “Wintermaw”.

Works as a black operative for the Hollow Dominion, seeking to reclaim or erase Cerberan assets.

Key Rival Traits:
Liina has Eve’s original override codes, stolen from a rogue Dominion server.

She once infiltrated the Centurion’s outer decks under disguise—but Eve spotted her.

She offered Loona a place back at the helm of the Cerberan Resurgence. Loona refused.

“You were made for the fire, sister. Why douse yourself in these pathetic loyalties?”
— Liina, upon their last meeting

Their next encounter is inevitable. Eve has been scrambling signature scans of Loona’s quarters ever since.

🕯️ Emotional Depth
Loona is not emotionless. She is a creature of focused violence, suppressed affection, and unresolved grief.

She trusts only two people fully: Derrian and Eve.

She has memories of a mother that don’t exist—planted into her clone psyche, like an ache with no origin.

She occasionally listens to an old, static-laced recording of Kaelen’s laugh, thinking no one knows. Eve does.
