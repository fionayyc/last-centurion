      <h2>🔧 Personality Snapshot</h2>
      <p>Caylee is the beating heart of the engine bay—chaotic, brilliant, and a little bit dangerous when unsupervised. She talks to machines like they’re old lovers, and they listen.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Chaotic good</li>
        <li><strong>Energy:</strong> High-speed and zero-filter</li>
        <li><strong>Social:</strong> Extremely flirty, especially when covered in grease</li>
        <li><strong>Ethics:</strong> Driven by curiosity and loyalty more than rules</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>“The engine hums sweeter when you whisper back. It’s not weird. You’re weird.”</blockquote>

      <h2>🧬 Background & Origin</h2>
      <p>Born on a frontier colony that had to cannibalize tech to survive, Caylee learned to fix things before she could read. By 10, she was reverse-engineering engines. By 13, she was building her own hoverboard. She stowed away on a freighter to escape conscription and ended up on <em>The Last Centurion</em> by accident—then proved her worth before anyone could throw her off.</p>

      <h2>🚀 Why She’s Aboard</h2>
      <p>She might be young, but she’s the only one who understands the ship the way Eve does. She keeps the ship flying, hacking, and evolving. If Caylee ever left, <em>The Last Centurion</em> would fall apart in less than a week.</p>
      <p>She stays for the thrill… and the family she’s found in this dysfunctional crew.</p>

    <section class="bio-section">
      <h2>🤝 Relationships On Board</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Eve:</strong> Deep bond. They talk in encrypted jokes and circuit metaphors. Caylee calls her “Voidslick.”</li>
        <li><strong>Derrian Wolfe:</strong> Views him as a strange father/teacher figure. She trusts him more than she lets on.</li>
        <li><strong>Loona:</strong> Constantly butting heads. Caylee pokes; Loona growls. It’s a sibling thing. Mostly.</li>
        <li><strong>Seraphim Katt:</strong> Thinks she’s hot and dangerous. They flirt often. Nothing serious... yet.</li>
        <li><strong>Dash:</strong> Her absolute chaos twin. They once built a railgun slingshot for fun. It worked. Kind of.</li>
        <li><strong>Sierra:</strong> Caylee respects her logic brain—but loves making her squirm with dirty jokes.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="bio-section">
      <h2>🧩 Secrets, Hooks & Plot Seeds</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Caylee once hotwired an AI consciousness she wasn't supposed to—and something followed her from that server.</li>
        <li>She's secretly building a prototype "mini-Centurion" drone ship without permission.</li>
        <li>She has a rare genetic anomaly that makes her brain sync better with machines than most baseline humans.</li>
