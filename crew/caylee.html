    <h1>👤 Caylee Jay</h1>
    <p><strong>Species:</strong> Anthro Jackal<br>
       <strong>Role:</strong> Chief Engineer<br>

       <strong>Appearance:</strong> Tan fur, golden eyes, athletic and wiry build<br>
       <strong>Style:</strong> Bikini top, cutoff shorts, goggles on her head or around her neck</p>

    <h2>🔧 Personality Snapshot</h2>
    <p>Caylee is the beating heart of the engine bay—chaotic, brilliant, and a little bit dangerous when unsupervised. She talks to machines like they’re old lovers, and they listen.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Chaotic good</li>
      <li><strong>Energy:</strong> High-speed and zero-filter</li>
      <li><strong>Social:</strong> Extremely flirty, especially when covered in grease</li>
      <li><strong>Ethics:</strong> Driven by curiosity and loyalty more than rules</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote><em>“The engine hums sweeter when you whisper back. It’s not weird. You’re weird.”</em></blockquote>

    <h2>🧬 Background & Origin</h2>
    <p>Born on a frontier colony that had to cannibalize tech to survive, Caylee learned to fix things before she could read. By 10, she was reverse-engineering engines. By 13, she was building her own hoverboard. She stowed away on a freighter to escape conscription and ended up on <em>The Last Centurion</em> by accident—then proved her worth before anyone could throw her off.</p>

    <h2>🚀 Why She’s Aboard</h2>
    <p>She might be young, but she’s the only one who understands the ship the way Eve does. She keeps the ship flying, hacking, and evolving. If Caylee ever left, <em>The Last Centurion</em> would fall apart in less than a week.</p>
    <p>She stays for the thrill… and the family she’s found in this dysfunctional crew.</p>

    <h2>🤝 Relationships On Board</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Eve:</strong> Deep bond. They talk in encrypted jokes and circuit metaphors. Caylee calls her “Voidslick.”</li>
      <li><strong>Derrian Wolfe:</strong> Views him as a strange father/teacher figure. She trusts him more than she lets on.</li>
      <li><strong>Loona:</strong> Constantly butting heads. Caylee pokes; Loona growls. It’s a sibling thing. Mostly.</li>
      <li><strong>Seraphim Katt:</strong> Thinks she’s hot and dangerous. They flirt often. Nothing serious... yet.</li>
      <li><strong>Dash:</strong> Her absolute chaos twin. They once built a railgun slingshot for fun. It worked. Kind of.</li>
      <li><strong>Sierra:</strong> Caylee respects her logic brain—but loves making her squirm with dirty jokes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧩 Secrets, Hooks & Plot Seeds</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Caylee once hotwired an AI consciousness she wasn't supposed to—and something followed her from that server.</li>
      <li>She's secretly building a prototype "mini-Centurion" drone ship without permission.</li>
      <li>She has a rare genetic anomaly that makes her brain sync better with machines than most baseline humans.</li>
    </ul>
