ü¶¥ Skull Squadron
Craft: VF-Blackline Veratech Fighters
Number: 2
Role: Heavy interceptors / Mecha-capable dogfighters
Design Influence: F-14 Tomcat x Macross Veritech

Overview:
The Veratechs are shape-shifting multi-role fighters capable of transitioning between:

Flight Mode: Classic high-speed fighter configuration with folding wings and tail thrust vectors

Guardian Mode: Partial transformation for aerial hover combat, ideal for precision mid-air stability

Battroid Mode: Full mecha form, used for close-quarters combat or spacewalk boarding operations

Loadout:
Twin Railgun Cannons (wrist-mounted in robot mode, nose-mounted in fighter mode): Fires high-velocity penetrator rounds that bypass most conventional shielding

Missile Loadout:

Seeker Swarms (anti-fighter)

Tungsten Crunchers (anti-capital armor)

EMP Quills (electronic warfare)

Energy Blade (in mecha form): Retractable for dueling and emergency EVA combat

Pilot Notes:
Used by only the most elite crew‚Äîlikely one of them is flown by Seraphim when things get spicy

Eve maintains launch clearance overrides due to how dangerous they are to internal systems if mishandled

‚ÄúThey don't just fly‚Äîthey fight like gods in steel.‚Äù
