## 💡 Lore & Deployment

Skull Squadron was originally designed for covert Dominion infiltration — their transformation modes allowed for mobility in hostile urban zones as well as vacuum environments. Now repurposed for the Centurion, they serve as the ship’s first line of offense and last line of defense.

Pilots must pass a near-impossible sync test to fly one solo.

## 🪐 Mission History

- **Operation Rift Wall:** Cleared Dominion blockade above Kestran 4
- **Red Sector Reclamation:** Evacuated agents under fire while engaged in low-orbit dogfight
- **Void Hunt:** Intercepted unmarked vessel attempting to probe Eve’s neural array

Each Skull carries kill markers scored into their armor plating — a badge of honor and warning alike.
