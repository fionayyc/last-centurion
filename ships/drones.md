Callsign Options:

Echo Squadron â€“ [Stealth & Interception Wing]

Overview:
Designed and controlled directly by Eve, the Spectre drones are fast, adaptive, and utterly ruthless. They operate as tactile extensions of Eveâ€™s will, capable of synchronizing mid-maneuver or executing split-squad strategies simultaneously.

Loadout:
Dual Pulse Cannons â€“ Light but accurate energy weapons

Swarm Missiles â€“ Microtracking munitions capable of saturating ECM defenses

Blade Wings â€“ Can transform wings into energy lances for ramming attacks

Evasion Suites â€“ Ghost signature, sensor jammers, chaff bursts

Maintenance:
Maintained and lovingly upgraded by Caylee, who gives them nicknames, stickers, and sometimes snacks (???)

Eve constantly tweaks their learning protocols, occasionally giving them creepy laughter routines just to mess with intruders
