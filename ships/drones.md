> Silent. Swift. Precise. Eve's autonomous drone wings form the eyes, ears, and claws of the Last Centurion — operating with brutal efficiency and eerie grace.

## 🛠️ Overview

- **Designation:** Echo Squadron (Black), Phantom Squadron (Silver)
- **Unit Count:** 6 per wing (12 total)
- **Control:** Fully synchronized with E.V.E.L.I.N.E. (Eve)
- **Deployment:** Automated from underbelly hangar compartments

## 🚀 Capabilities

| System | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Stealth Coating** | Adaptive visual distortion and radiation baffles |
| **Precision Thrusters** | Optimized for tight, silent maneuvers in zero-G |
| **Pulse Cannons** | Twin short-burst energy cannons for hit-and-run strikes |
| **Recon Package** | Long-range sensor suite, data relay, encrypted scan |

Each drone is the size of a small fighter but has no cockpit. Their streamlined frame gives them unrivaled speed and agility in cluttered space.

## 🧠 AI Integration

- Eve can pilot all 12 drones simultaneously while managing ship-wide systems
- Drone behavior is modular — recon, surgical strike, decoy, or swarm
- In Red Sector lockdowns, drones patrol corridors to ensure crew safety

---

## 🪐 Operational Roles

- **Echo Squadron:** Primary recon and retrieval. Painted matte black for deep-space stealth.
- **Phantom Squadron:** Strike support and interdiction. Painted reflective silver for sensor ghosts and battlefield misdirection.

Drones often operate in tandem — Echo scouts and tracks, Phantom intercepts and neutralizes.

## 🧩 Advanced Functions

- **Swarm Syncing:** Multiple drones can coordinate to overload shields or form kinetic walls mid-flight
- **Signal Cloaking:** Drones can mimic wreckage or debris to remain undetected
- **Autonomy Limits:** Each drone carries 6 minutes of independent logic buffer in the event of Eve’s connection loss

## 🔒 Red Sector Restrictions

While drones do not enter the Club Centurion main floors, they are permitted to hover in proximity for security response.

Echo drones occasionally accompany Caylee into unauthorized decks “just to make sure.”

## 💀 Deployment Log Excerpts

- **Op Glass Arrow:** Phantom drones disabled enemy thruster arrays during a Centurion dive
- **Rift Echo 9:** Echo wing tracked subdimensional fluctuations and captured living Rift echoes
- **Silent War:** All 12 drones executed a full-stealth strike against a pirate flotilla in less than 40 seconds

They make no sound. They leave no survivors.
