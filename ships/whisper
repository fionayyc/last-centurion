🚛 1. “The Whisper”
Class: Modified Corellian-style Freighter
Length: ~35 meters
Primary Role: Smuggling, deep-space cargo runs, crew insertion/extraction under fire
Design Inspiration: Ebon Hawk / YT-series freighter

Overview:
“The Whisper” is rugged, fast, and dirtier than Eve would like to admit. It's been rebuilt and re-skinned so many times it technically counts as its own make and model. This is the ship’s muscle freighter—used when you need to haul goods, lay low, or make a deal in the underworld without flying a capital ship into orbit.

Key Features:
Hidden compartments for contraband or stowaways

Sensor-deflection plating, optimized for stealth operations

Rear modular cargo bay with atmospheric seal—can carry up to two hover vehicles or a mobile med lab

Heavy turret on dorsal spine + side-mounted blaster cannons

Reinforced landing struts for desert, snow, and zero-atmo landings

Interior:
Cramped bunks, auxiliary cockpit nav station, and a kitchen that always smells like Dash’s terrible ration soup

Personalized with graffiti tags, pinup holo-decals, and at least three hidden weapons lockers

Caylee once retrofitted the engines with a pirate spike mod that can override landing zone permissions

Eve calls it “the flying garbage wombat.” Dash calls it “home sweet junk heap.”
