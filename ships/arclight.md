![The Arclight Placeholder](../assets/arclight-placeholder.jpg)

> The analytical edge of the Last Centurion. _The Arclight_ is the ship’s fast-response science and defense shuttle — swift, durable, and surgically outfitted for deep scans, planetary surveys, and rapid away missions.

## 🚐 Shuttle Overview

- **Class:** Multipurpose shuttle
- **Length:** 22 meters
- **Primary Role:** Scientific analysis, atmospheric recon, agile away-team transport
- **Drive Systems:** Advanced FTL core + sublight impulse thrusters
- **Shields:** Twin-layered deflector array + emergency repulsor flare

## 🧪 Internal Systems

| System | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sensor Suite Mk7** | Long-range and wide-spectrum scans, Rift-reactive detection |
| **Laboratory Pod** | Onboard mobile lab for tissue, tech, or Rift sample analysis |
| **Triage Medbay** | Equipped with stabilization cradle and AI-assisted diagnostics |
| **Shield-Tuned Hull** | Resistant to solar storms and gravitational anomalies |

## ⚔️ Defense & Maneuverability

- **Pulse Turrets:** Top and underbelly-mounted, Eve-controlled if crewed light
- **Micro-EMP Mines:** For disabling chasing ships or satellites
- **Grav-Lock Clamps:** Allow docking with derelicts, orbital stations, or Rift ruins

---

## 👩‍🔬 Crew & Usage

Typical crew:
- **Sierra (Science Officer)** — leads away missions
- **Veyla or Sileya** — provides medical support or psychic foresight
- **Seraphim or Dash** — for protection, charm, or piloting

The Arclight’s design balances combat survivability with the capacity to record and examine anomalies mid-flight. It often operates ahead of the Centurion during cautious entries into Rift-affected space.

## 🧩 Mission Highlights

- **Rift Echo 12:** Recorded and contained a Rift tear before it destabilized a local moon’s gravity field
- **Black Ice Run:** Used shielded hull to bypass solar storm and extract cryo-pods from derelict colony ship
- **Shardveil Encounter:** Survived proximity contact with a Rift specter — still under quarantine review

---

## 🧠 Integration

- Linked to Eve via encrypted auxiliary uplink
- Can operate semi-autonomously for short recon runs
- Features override protocols for Captain, XO, and Sierra only
