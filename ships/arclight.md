🧬 2. “The Arclight”
Class: Science-Defense Recon Shuttle
Length: ~18 meters
Primary Role: Exploration, precision landing ops, defensive escort
Design Inspiration: Delta Flyer from Star Trek: Voyager

Overview:
“The Arclight” is the high-end systems platform used by Sierra, Vahlia, and mission specialists for exploration, deep scans, Veil-anomaly intercepts, and long-range field testing. Its design is aerodynamic, elegant, and heavily shielded—able to enter atmospheres or energy pockets no freighter would dare touch.

Key Features:
Advanced sensor suite capable of deep-scan geological, biological, and Veil signatures

Shield-pulse emitter—projected bubble to repel microdebris or null-energies

Mini medical bay with zero-g surgery gurney

Cloaking array (limited use, requires cooldown)

Two retractable phaser/laser banks, optimized for defensive fire or fast takedowns

Interior:
Soft-lit console wrap, hover-chairs that magnetize to floor surfaces, and one seat coded to Sierra’s biometric lock

Sileya's calming charms hang from a ceiling rail—crew often reports fewer headaches when aboard

Storage modules along both sides house sample canisters, surgical gear, and weapon diagnostics pods

Eve refers to it as “the child Sierra will leave me for someday.”
