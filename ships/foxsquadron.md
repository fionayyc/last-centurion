## 🎮 Dash's Domain

Dash considers Fox Squadron her personal playground. Each fighter is tuned to her reflex specs and features minor “vanity” tweaks:
- Neon underglow trace lines (toggle-able)
- Customized paintwork with unique sigils per fighter
- Audio override to play music or taunt enemies during maneuvers

---

## 🧪 Tactical Deployment

Fox Squadron is often used in:
- Escort missions requiring speed and formation shifting
- Fighter screens ahead of jump entries
- Hit-and-fade strikes against supply depots or exposed frigates
- Simulation training against Eve’s drones

Formation pattern: **Viper Coil** — a spiral loop formation that splits and remerges mid-flight.

## 🧩 Quirks & Lore

- Fox 3 is rumored to be “haunted” after surviving three solo returns with no pilot
- Fox 1’s kill record is stenciled in Dash’s bunk — in permanent ink
- The ships have an unofficial motto: _“Fast, loud, gone.”_

## 🛠️ Support & Maintenance

- Maintained by Caylee and her automated helper units
- Stored in forward hangar bay
- Reload time between launches: 8 minutes with Eve assist, 15 minutes manual

Fox Squadron doesn’t ask permission. It asks who’s fast enough to keep up.
