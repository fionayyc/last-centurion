## 🛠️ Lore & Missions

_The Whisper_ has slipped through Dominion blockades, privateer checkpoints, and blacksite orbital nets. It was originally acquired through less-than-legal means and retrofitted by Caylee over the course of six months.

### Notable Runs:
- **Op Silver Veil:** Extracted a defector mid-wormhole collapse
- **Rift Echo 7:** Used as bait in a gravity mine ambush (and survived)
- **Club Centurion Smuggle:** Secretly imported rare spirits for Caylee’s “experimental cocktails”

---

## 👥 Access Control

Typically flown by:
- Dash (when discretion is needed)
- Caylee (when mischief is involved)
- Seraphim (when someone’s about to get seduced, blackmailed, or both)

Only Derrian, Loona, and Eve have override access codes.

_The Whisper doesn’t make noise. It makes exits._
