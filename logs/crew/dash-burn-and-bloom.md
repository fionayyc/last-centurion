# Scene: “Burn and Bloom”
**Location:** Flight Deck, The Last Centurion, Hangar Bay Alpha

The acrid scent of scorched carbon lingered in the air, clinging to the steel bones of Hangar Bay Alpha like a phantom. The firefight was over. The wreckage of two enemy interceptors lay crumpled in docking clamps, still sizzling. Mechanic drones skittered between debris, dragging cables, extinguishing flames.

Alexandra Dash sat atop her ship—*Shatterkiss*—legs swinging idly over the starboard wing. Her rainbow hair was tied up messily, streaks of grease smudging her cheek like warpaint. One goggle lens cracked, the other still glinting neon pink as it reflected the bay’s emergency lighting.

A stimstick dangled from her lips. Lit. Barely touched.

She exhaled, watching the thin trail of smoke curl into the open hangar’s dark.

“Three bogeys, two kills, one save,” she muttered, tapping ash off the stim. “Hell of a day.”

“Four bogeys,” came a familiar voice—smooth, dangerous, and vaguely amused.

Dash looked over her shoulder and grinned.

Seraphim Katt leaned against a maintenance scaffold, arms crossed beneath the open V of her flight suit. She wasn’t in armor, but her stance was all predator. All purpose.

“Oh, right,” Dash said, hopping down from her ship. “Forgot about the one you seduced mid-chase and convinced to crash into his own wingmate. Classic Katty.”

“I aim to please,” Seraphim replied, tilting her head, that mismatched gaze glittering.

“Bet you do.”

The tension was playful—sharp like static—but laced with something heavier. Residual adrenaline. The hum of near-death still vibrating in their bones. Dash walked past her, peeled off her pilot’s gloves, and let them drop with a slap onto the deck.

“You alright?” Seraphim asked, quieter now.

Dash paused, shoulders tensing, before slowly turning to face her. “Yeah. Just…” Her voice caught for half a beat. “Got too close out there. My HUD blinked out for six seconds. Six. I was flying on gut and fuck-you-luck.”

Seraphim stepped forward, gently brushing Dash’s cheek with a fingertip. “Your gut’s damn good. But luck?” She leaned in, whispering near Dash’s ear. “That’s what I’m for.”

Dash smirked, letting herself breathe again. “You saying you’re my lucky charm, vod?”

“I’m saying I don’t want to see you burn up alone.”

There it was again. That line between flirtation and something deeper, unspoken. A connection forged not from softness—but from shared violence, resilience, and too many near-misses in open space.

“Then fly with me next time,” Dash said.

“I always do,” Seraphim replied. “Even when you don’t see me.”

They stood there a moment longer, the hum of the ship’s systems thrumming around them, *The Last Centurion* alive and watching.

Then the hangar lights flickered back to full.

Dash slapped Seraphim on the ass on her way past. “Come on, I need a drink and a reason to lie about how badass I was.”

Seraphim laughed, following close behind. “Oh, I’ll write the legend for you. But I get to be the sexy villain in it.”

“Babe,” Dash called over her shoulder, “you already are.”
